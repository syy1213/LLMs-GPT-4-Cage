"19The research introduced here is based on a similar conceptusing rigid C3-symmetrical units as building blocks for thesynthesis of covalent bound nanocage compounds. Thedi?erence to most systems known today is the synergisticdirection of six hydroxyl groups into the centre of the cavity.As rigid building blocks triamine 120and salicylic dialdehyde 2were chosen ?rst to give the endo-functionalised adamantoidnanocage compound 3in 58% yield in a single step (Fig. 1 andFig. 2). zNo addition of templating metal salts or promotingacids was necessary. The reaction procedure is very simple:stirring a mixture of the reactants 1and 2in a ratio of 2 : 3 inTHF at room temperature for seven days. The deep orangeprecipitate was ?ltered o?, washed with some THF and driedin vacuo to give 3with a purity su?cient for elemental analysis.",comprehensive synthesis
"Notes and referenceszSynthesis of 3: A solution of 120(150 mg, 0.50 mmol) and 2(156 mg,0.75 mmol) in dry THF (30 mL) was stirred for 7 d at roomtemperature. The orange precipitate was collected on a Buchnerfunnel, washed with THF (3 /C24 mL) and dried in vacuo to give160 mg (58%) of cage compound 3as an orange solid with mp4410 1C, IR (KBr): ~n= 1625 cm/C01, UV¨CVis (THF): l(nm) =228, 336, 349, 377.

Another portion ofNaBH 4(80 mg, 2.1 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred foran additional two days. 4 mL dichloromethane and 4 mL water wereadded. The layers were separated and the aqueous phase was extractedwith dichloromethane. The combined organic extract was dried withsodium sulfate and solvent was removed to give 42 mg (76%) of 6asan o?-white solid with mp 4410 1C (dec.).",comprehensive synthesis
"Synthesis of 5-tert-butyl-2-methoxyisophthalaldehyde  (5):  To a suspension of salicyldialdehyde 2 (200 mg, 1.0 mmol) and potassium carbonate (770 mg, 5.57 mmol) in DMF (10 mL) iodomethane (0.06 mL, 0.97 mmol) were added and heated at 60-70 oC for 6h. After cooling to room temperature, water (20 mL) and dichloromethane (20 mL) was added and the layers separated. The organic layer was washed with water (3 x 25 mL), aqueous ammonium chloride solution (1N, 25 mL), and brine (25 mL) and dried over sodium sulphate. The solvents were removed by rotary evaporation and the oily orange residue purified by flash chromatography (SiO2, petrol ether/ethylacetate 4:1) to give after drying in vacuo 180 mg (82%) of a pale yellow solid. M.p. 82-84 oC.",comprehensive synthesis

The formed yellow precipitate was filtered, washed with THF and dried in vacuo to give 70 mg of a pale yellow solid.",comprehensive synthesis
"Reaction of bisaldehyde 5 with triamine 1: A solution of 1 (50 mg, 0.17 mmol) and 5 (55 mg, 0.25 mmol) in dry THF (10 mL) was stirred at room temperature. After three and twelve days the rection mixture was analysed by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy.",comprehensive synthesis
