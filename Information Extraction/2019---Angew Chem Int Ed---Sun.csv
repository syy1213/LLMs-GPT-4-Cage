S24   SUPPORTING INFORMATION          S2  Experimental Procedures  General remark. Dichloromethane was freshly distilled from CaH2. The other commercial chemicals were used without any further treatment. The precursors including 4,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]-thiadiazole (TBTD) and 5,5'-(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4,7-diyl)diisophthalaldehyde (BTDP) were prepared according to the published procedures.[1]   Scheme S1. Schematic synthesis and molecular structure of MTC1.  Synthesis of 4,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (TBTD). To a degassed mixture of 4,7-dibromo benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (0.50 g, 1.70 mmol), bis(pinacolato)-diboron (1.30 g, 5.10 mmol), potassium acetate (2.70 g, 27.20 mmol), and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME, 40.0 mL) in a 100 mL three-necked flask, PdCl2(dppf) (62.2 mg) was added. The resultant mixture was heated to 100¡ãC with stirring under nitrogen atmosphere for 14.0 hours. The reaction was cooled to room temperature and filtered under reduced pressure. The filtrate was concentrated under vacuum, and the solid was successively chromotographed on a silica gel column with hexane and hexane/CH2Cl2 (v/v = 4/1) as the eluent, respectively. The pure product was obtained as the pale yellow solid in the yield of 80% (533 mg). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): ¦Ä 8.13 (s, 2H), 1.44 (s, 24H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 100 MHz): ¦Ä 157.15, 137.88, 84.59, 25.06.  Preparation of 5,5'-(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4,7-diyl)diisophthalaldehyde (BTDP). To a degassed mixture of TBTD (0.20 g, 0.52 mmol), 5-bromoisophthalaldehyde (0.28 g, 1.30 mmol), K2CO3 (0.43 g, 3.12 mmol), 1,4-dioxane (10.0 mL), and H2O (10.0 mL) in a 100 mL three-neck flask, Pd(PPh3)4 (30.0 mg) was added. The resultant mixture was heated to 100¡ãC with stirring under nitrogen atmosphere for 14.0 hours. The reaction was cooled to room temperature and poured into 100.0 mL water. The residue was washed with excessive amount of water, CH3OH, toluene, and CHCl3 for several times. Because BTDP is insoluble in common organic solvents (such as DMSO, DMF, CH2Cl2, CHCl3, and CH3OH), it is hard to separated using column chromatography and to get its NMR spectrum. As a consequence, BTDP obtained was directly used in the next experiment.  Preparation of MTC1: To a suspension of BTDP (40.0 mg, 0.10 mmol) in dry dichloromethane (20.0 mL), a solution of chiral (R,R)-cyclohexanediamine (22.8 mg, 0.20 mmol) in dry dichloromethane (10.0 mL) was added slowly. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 5 days. Then the reaction mixture was filtered, and organic phase was evaporated under reduced pressure. The yellow product was obtained by the recrystallization of crude product in dichloromethane and methanol, in a yield of 72% (40.0 mg). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): ¦Ä 8.43 (s, 6H), 8.30 (s, 12H), 7.99 (s, 6H), 7.77 (s, 6H), 7.40 (s, 6H), 3.51-3.40 (m, 12H), 1.89-1.53 (m, 48H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 100 MHz): ¦Ä 160.24, 159.59, 153.79, 137.70, 137.35, 136.99, 133.66, 132.32, 129.03, 128.18, 127.53, 75.88, 75.13, 58.63, 51.03, 33.64, 33.05, 24.78, 24.63. MALDI-TOF MS: an isotopic cluster peaking at m/z 1670.16, Calcd. for C102H96N18S3, [M]+ 1670.17. Elemental analysis calculated (%) for C102H96N18S3: C, 73.35; H, 5.79; N, 15.09. found: C, 73.39; H, 5.84; N, 15.12. The single crystals of MTC1 were obtained by the slow of diffusion CH3OH into CH2Cl2 solution containing MTC1.  Preparation of Pd@MTC1-x/y. To a CHCl3 (3.0 mL) solution of MTC1 (10.0 mg, 6.00 ¦Ìmol), a CHCl3 solution (12.0, 30.0, 60.0, 120.0, 180.0, 360.0, 600.0, and 800.0 ¦ÌL) containing Pd(OAc)2 in the concentration of 0.10 mol L?1 was added, namely 1/5, 1/2, 1/1, 1/0.5, 1/0.33, 1/0.17, 1/0.1, and 1/0.033 equivalent of MTC1, respectively. After stirring for overnight at 25¡ãC, a methanol solution of NaBH4 (6.0 equivalents of Pd(OAc)2) was added dropwise into the reaction mixture at 25¡ãC. After stirring for 3.0 hours, this reaction solution was concentrated under reduced vacuum to about 0.5 mL. Then ethanol was added to precipitate the Pd@MTC1-x/y (x and y was denoted as the mole number of Pd2+ and MTC1, respectively), the solution was centrifuged and washed with ethanol (8.0 mL ¡ä 3). A series of Pd@MTC1-x/y composites, including Pd@MTC1-1/5, Pd@MTC1-1/2, Pd@MTC1-1/1, Pd@MTC1-1/0.5, Pd@MTC1-1/0.33, Pd@MTC1-1/0.17, Pd@MTC1-1/0.1, and Pd@MTC1-1/0.033 was dried at 25¡ãC under vacuum for overnight. The content of Pd for these samples was determined by ICP as 0.7, 1.1, 2.0, 8.5, 11.0, 16.0, 21.6, and 28.6wt%, respectively.",comprehensive synthesis

Sequential reactions. 4-Nitrophenylboronic acid (60.0 ¦Ìmol), Pd@MTC1-x/y (7.6 mg), and iPr2NEt (300 ¦Ìmol) were added into 1.0 mL CD3CN/D2O (v/v = 4/1) in a 5 mL quartz tube. The resultant mixture was stirred at room temperature upon the irradiation with a 25 W blue LED light under a balloon of O2. Yield of product was determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy using 1,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)benzene as an internal standard in CD3OD. After the oxidative hydroxylation reaction monitored by 1H NMR SUPPORTING INFORMATION          S4  spectroscopy, 5.0 ¦ÌL resultant solution and NaBH4 (0.13 mmol) were added into 2.5 mL water in quartz cell at 25¡ãC. The conversion of hydride reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol was monitored using the electronic absorption spectra at short intervals.  In the recycle test, after each cycle, the catalyst was separated by centrifugation and washed by CH3OH (three times), and dried at 25¡ãC under vacuum overnight before next use.  A Job plot. A Job plot was constructed to determine the binding stoichiometry between MTC1 and Pd2+ by monitoring the change in fluorescence intensity (¦Ëem = 494 nm) as a function of the mole fraction of MTC1. Stock solutions (1.0 ¡Á 10-3 mol L?1) of MTC1 and Pd2+ were prepared in DMF, respectively. Samples were prepared with different mole fractions of MTC1 and Pd2+ while maintaining the total concentration of ([MTC1] + [Pd2+]) for each test sample solution at 10.0 ¦Ìmol L?1.  Characterizations. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DPX 400 spectrometer (1H NMR: 400 MHz, 13C NMR: 100 MHz) in CDCl3 and CD3OD. 1H NMR spectra were referenced internally using the residual solvent resonances (¦Ä = 7.26 ppm for CDCl3 and ¦Ä = 3.31 ppm for CD3OD) relative to SiMe4. 13C NMR spectrum was referenced internally by using the solvent resonance (¦Ä = 77.16 ppm for CDCl3 and ¦Ä = 49.00 ppm for CD3OD). Electronic absorption spectra were recorded on a Lambda 750 spectrophotometer. Steady-state fluorescence spectroscopic studies were performed on an F4500 (Hitachi) spectrophotometer with a PMT voltage of 700 V and a scan speed of 1200 nm/min, the slit width for both excitation and emission was 5 nm. Time-resolved fluorescence lifetime experiments were performed by the time-correlated single-photon-counting (TCSPC) technique. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were taken on a Bruker BIFLEX III ultra-high resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer with ¦Á-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix. Elemental analysis was performed on an Elementar Vavio El III elemental analyzer. The morphologies of metal nanoparticles and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images were studied using a transmission electron microscopy (JEM-2100F) at an operation voltage of 200 kV. The samples were prepared by placing a drop of product in ethanol onto a continuous carbon-coated copper TEM grid and allowed to dry before the measurements. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were collected with a TTR III multi-function X-ray diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 300 mA with Cu K¦Á radiation. The nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms were measured at 77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 PLUS HD88 system with the samples degassed at room temperature for 24.0 hours before the measurement. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were conducted on an ESCALAB 250Xi system. Al K¦Á X-ray (6 mA, 12 KV) was utilized as the irradiation source. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Perkin-Elmer instrument over the temperature range of 25 to 800¡ãC under nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 5¡ãC/min. ESR measurements were performed at room temperature on Bruker Elexsys E580 X-band. The Pd content of samples was determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis with an Agilent 7700X ICP-MS instrument.  Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were carried out using CHI 760E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua Instrument, Shanghai, China) in a three-electrode electrochemical cell. The experiments were conducted in anhydrous dichloromethane with tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 mol L?1) as supporting electrolyte. The working electrode was a glassy carbon electrode. The counter electrode was an Ag wire. The reference electrode was based on the Ag/Ag+ electrode, which was connected to the solution by a Luggin capillary whose tip was placed close to the working electrode. It was corrected for junction potentials by being referenced to the ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) couple. Typically, the sample solution was purged with nitrogen for 20 min, and then the voltammograms were recorded at ambient temperature. The scan rate was 0.1 V s?1 for the CV measurement.  Single crystal crystallography. Crystallographical data of organic cage was collected on a diffractometer of SuperNova, Dual, Cu at home/near, AtlasS2 with Cu K¦Á radiation (¦Ë = 1.54184 ?) at 200.00 K. The structure was solved by the direct method (SHELXS-2014) and refined by full-matrix least-squares (SHELXL-2014) on F2.[2] Anisotropic thermal parameters were used for the non-hydrogen atoms and isotropic parameters for the hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen atoms were added geometrically and refined using a riding model. Crystallographic and refinement parameters for organic cage are compiled in Table S1 (Supporting Information). Because there are seriously disordered solvent molecules in the cage pores, ¡®SQUEEZE¡¯ command was employed. CCDC 1935950 for MTC1 contains the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper. These data can be obtained free of charge from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif.  Theoretical simulations. MTC1 was firstly optimized at the B3LYP/3-21G* level of theory to provide a scanned energy profiles about the rotations of BTD unit, and finally refined at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. All calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 software package.[3]   For the purpose of investigating potential coordination sites of MTC1 towards divalent palladium ions, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out on the basis of B97XD/BSI, using Gaussian 09 D.01 software package.[4,5] The BSI denotes a mixed basis set, which SDDALL for Pd and 6-311G(D) for nonmetal atoms.[6,7] The most preferred coordination structure of MTC1 toward divalent palladium ion was optimized, Figure S17 (Supporting Information), showing the complexation of Pd ion using one imine nitrogen atom and one BTD nitrogen atom and two acetate anions. The binding energy is -28.62 kcal mol?1. For a comparative study, the coordination site between Pd2+ ion and CC3 was calculated as well, and the binding energy is -19.29 kcal mol?1. The larger absolute value for the binding energy of Pd2+ ion with MTC1 than that of CC3 indicates the stronger complexation for the former cage.
