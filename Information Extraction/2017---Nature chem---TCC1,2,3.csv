"Results and discussionTo access new building blocks that might form 1D pore channels, we?rst synthesized a series of tetraaldehyde cage precursors withdifferent linker lengths (Fig. 2a). Three chiral tubular covalentcages, TCC1 ,TCC2 and TCC3 , were then synthesized from theseprecursors in [3+6] cycloimination reactions with R,R-o rS,S-cyclo-hexanediamine (CHDA) (Fig. 1e (Supplementary Section 1.3 givesdetailed experimental methods and synthesis of aldehyde pre-cursors)). Unlike our previous family of tetrahedral cages19,21,22,these tubular cages comprise two approximately triangularwindows, one at each end of the ＆tube＊, and they can be thoughtof as linear ditopic tectons for the assembly of 1D nanotubes1Department of Chemistry and Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool, Crown Street, Liverpool L69 7ZD, UK.2School of Chemistry, Universityof Southampton, High ?eld, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK.3Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London, South Kensington, London SW7 2AZ, UK.",affiliation

However, unlike forTCC1 and TCC3 , activation of bulk crystalline TCC2- R/TCC2 -Sgave a poorly crystalline material that was non-porous to nitrogenat 77 K (BET surface area =26 m2g?1(Fig. 4h)). In situ desolvationof a single crystal of TCC2 -R/TCC2 -S(space group symmetry Cc)gave a desolvated crystal structure for TCC2- R/TCC2 -S(spacegroup symmetry R/overbar3 (Supplementary Fig. 25)) in which the nanotubesare preserved, but a collapse of the cage occurs.

"In particular, the calculations suggest that solvent templating hasa signi ?cant in ?uence on TCC2 crystallization: there is a substantialenergy gap of 56 kJ mol?1between the experimental solvate forTCC2 -R/TCC2 -S(space group symmetry Cc, the highlightedpoint in Fig. 5e) and the predicted structure of lowest energy. Forthe three materials that can be desolvated to yield porous solids,the experimental structures are much closer to the globalminimum of their respective landscapes ( TCC1 -R, +16 kJ mol?1(Fig. 5a); TCC1 -R/TCC1 -S, +11 kJ mol?1(Fig. 5d) or at the globalminimum energy ( TCC3 -R/TCC3 -S(Fig. 5f)). Hence, these CSPcalculations might rationalize the observed instability of TCC2 -R/TCC2 -Sto desolvation (Figs 5d 每f), an insight that is not intuitivelyobvious from the structures of the cage molecules (Fig. 2b,c) or fromthe gas-phase DFT dimer calculations.
