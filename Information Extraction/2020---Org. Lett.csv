Materials and General Methods All reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification. The compound 2S1 was prepared according to the literature procedures. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) and column chromatography were operated using silica gel 60F254 (E Merck) and silica gel 60F (Merck 9385, 0.040 ¨C0.063 mm), respectively. NMR spectra were recorded at 298 K using Bruker A V ANCE III 400 and 600 spectrometers, with working frequencies of 400/600 MHz for 1H, and 100/150 MHz for 13C, respectively. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm relative to the residual internal non-deuterated solvent signals (D2O: ¦Ä = 4.70 ppm, DMSO-d6: ¦Ä = 2.50 ppm, CD3CN: ¦Ä = 1.94 ppm). HRMS were measured using a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). X-ray crystallographic data were collected using a Bruker D8 Venture diffractometer. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were performed on a MicroCal system, VP-ITC model.   S3  2. Synthetic Procedures  Scheme S1. Synthesis of 13+¡¤3PF6?  Synthesis of 13+¡¤3PF6?: 1,3,5-tris(bromomethyl)benzene (0.87 g, 2.424 mmol) and 3-ethynylpyridine (1.00 g, 9.697 mmol) were combined in MeCN (100 mL). The mixture was stirred at 90 ¡ãC for about 24 h, during which precipitates were gradually observed in the solution. After cooling to ambient temperature, the precipitates were collected by filtration and washed with CH2Cl2 (50 mL) for three times. The resulting solid was dissolved in water, followed by adding saturated aqueous solution of NH4+¡¤PF6?. The resulting precipitates were collected by filtration, and washed with H2O (150 mL) for three times and dried at 50 ¡æ in a vacuum oven for 12 hours, yielding pure 13+¡¤3PF6? (1.25 g, 60%) as a light brown solid. 13+¡¤3PF6? was fully characterized by recording 1H NMR spectrum (Figure S1), 13C NMR spectrum (Figure S2), HSQC spectrum (Figure S3), HMBC spectrum (Figure S4) and mass spectrum (Figure S5). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3CN, 298 K) ¦Ä (ppm) 8.81 (s, 3H), 8.66 (d, J = 6.2 Hz, 3H), 8.58 (d, J = 8.2 Hz, 3H), 8.04 (dd, 3H), 7.52 (s, 3H), 5.67 (s, 6H), 4.03 (s, 3H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CD3CN) ¦Ä (ppm) 149.4, 148.0, 145.0, 135.2, 132.4, 129.3, 124.6, 87.8, 76.2, 64.4.

"S4    Scheme S2. Synthesis of 33+¡¤3PF6?   Synthesis of 33+¡¤3PF6?: Tris[(1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl]amine (TBTA, 154 mg, 0.291 mmol) and Cu(MeCN)4¡¤PF6 (108 mg, 0.291 mmol) were dissolved in acetone (250mL). The solution was degassed by bubbling nitrogen for 20 min. A solution of 1:1 mixture of 2 (141 mg, 0.581 mmol) and 13+¡¤3PF6? (500 mg, 0.581 mmol) in acetone (100 mL) was slowly added into the aforementioned solution under nitrogen for no less than 1 h. The reaction was stirred for 48 h at room temperature. A small amount of brown precipitates was observed, which might be polymeric byproducts, which were removed via filtration after the reaction was complete. To the filtrate, tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBA+¡¤Cl?, 1g) was added, after which light brown crude products were precipitated and collected by filtration, followed by washing with dichloromethane (100mL) for three times. The crude product was purified by column chromatography [SiO2: H2O/methanol/nitromethane (12:7:1)]. The combined fractions were concentrated in vacuo in order to remove most of organic solvent. A saturated aqueous solution of NH4+¡¤PF6? was then added, leading to precipitation of 33+¡¤3PF6?. The solid was collected by filtration, yielding pure 33+¡¤3PF6? (192 mg, 30 %) as a light yellow solid. The cage 33+¡¤3PF6? was fully characterized by recording the corresponding 1H NMR spectrum (Figure S6), 13C NMR spectrum (Figure S7), 1H-1H COSY spectrum (Figure S8), HSQC spectrum (Figure S9), HMBC spectrum (Figure S10) and mass spectrum (Figure S11). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3CN, 298K) ¦Ä (ppm) 9.08 (d, J = 8.2 Hz, 3H), 8.81 (d, J = 5.9 Hz, 3H), 8.48 (s, 3H), 8.17 (dd, J = 8.3, 6.0 Hz, 3H), 7.91 (s, 3H), 7.48 (s, 3H), 7.15 (s, 3H), 5.66 (s, 6H), 5.61 (s, 6H). 13C NMR S5  (100 MHz, CD3CN, 298K) ¦Ä (ppm) 144.5, 141.5, 140.7, 140.4, 136.7, 134.8, 132.6, 129.9, 128.9, 128.6, 122.3, 63.3, 53.2.

Water soluble counterparts, including 33+¡¤3Cl? or 33+¡¤3NO3? could be obtained via counterion exchange, which was accomplished by adding either TBA+¡¤Cl? or TBA+¡¤NO3? into the solution of 33+¡¤3PF6? in acetone, followed by filtration to collect the corresponding precipitates.
