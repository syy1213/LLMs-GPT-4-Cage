"All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma -Aldrich and used as received. Cage 1 was prepared as described elsewhere .1   Synthesis of Cage 2 Ethylenediamine (1.04 g, 0.0173 mol ) was dissolved in methanol (425 mL, HPLC grade) in 2 L round -bottomed flask cooled in an ice bath. 1,3,5 -Triformylbenzene ( 1.875 g, 0.0116 mol) was dissolved in methanol (575 mL, HPLC grade) and added dropwise over 24 hours to the ethylene diamine solution using a dropping  funnel under a nitrogen atmosphere. During this time, the reaction was stirred continuously. After this time, sodium borohydride(1.53 g, 0.0403 mol) was added and reaction astirred for a further 12 hours. Water (5 mL) was then added and the reaction stirr ed for a further 12 hours. The solvent was then removed under vacuum. The resulting white solid was extracted with chloroform (2 x 100 mL) and the remaining white solid removed by filtration. The solvent was then removed under vacuum and crude cage 2 obtai ned as white solid (crude yield = 2.1 g, 89 %). This was then purified using a Biotage Isolera four utilising a C18 reverse phase column with methanol/water as solvent. After removal of the solvent, cage 2 was obtained as a clear solid in a 42 % yield.",comprehensive synthesis
"Synthesis of [(Zn 6(¶Ã3-O3C)4(C48H72N12)](CO 3)(NO 3)2(H2O)19, 3 Cage 2 (10 mg, 1 equiv) was dissolved in 2 mL of methanol, followed by slow addition of Zn(NO 3).6H 2O (17mg, 4 equiv) dissolved in 2  mL of water. The reaction mixture was hea ted at 80o C in an oven for 24 hours. Crystallisation by slow slow evaporation afforded white cubic crystals , 3 (5mg, yield 21  %). To desolvate [(Zn 6(¶Ã3-O3C)4(C48H72N12)](CO 3)(NO 3)2(H2O)19 for powder XRD analysis , the sample was placed in a 0.5 mm capillary  within a Schlenk tube . This was heated  to 100  oC under vacuum for approximately 66 hours. The sample was then taken into an argon glove box where the capillary was sealed with grease and immediately flame sealed.",comprehensive synthesis
"Method A Cage 2 (10 mg, 1 equiv) was dissolved in 2 mL of methanol, followed by slow addition of Zn(NO 3).6H 2O (17mg, 4 equiv) dissolved in 2 mL of water. The reaction mixture was kept aside at room temperature for slow evaporation. Crystallisa tion by slow evaporation afforded white cubic crystals, 3 (5mg, Yield 21%).",comprehensive synthesis
"Method B Cage 2 (50 mg, 1 equiv), Zn(NO 3).6H 2O (67mg, 4 equiv) and water (2 mL) was taken in a 10 mL vial and heated with a hot air until all the reactants dissolve  The reaction mixture was allowed to cool under atmospheric air a white precipitate  was observed within 30-55 min and the reaction was kept under atmospheric air for 16  hours for reaction completion. The reaction mixture was centrifuged and the supernatant liquid was re moved. The precipitate was washed with water three times and centrifuged to remove unreacted starting material.",comprehensive synthesis
"The precipitate was air dried afforded a white microcrystalline powder (45 mg, 37  % yield ).",comprehensive synthesis
"Method  C Cage 2 (50 mg, 1 equiv), Zn(NO 3).6H 2O (67  mg, 4 equiv) and deoxygenated  water (2 mL) was taken in a 10 mL  schlenk flask and heated with a hot air gun until all the reactants 3  dissolve d under nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixture was  allowed to cool under nitrogen. A  turbid solution was observed wi thin 1 hour and slow evaporation of solvent under nitrogen atmosphere afforded white ppt.  The reaction mixture was centrifuged and the supernatant liquid was removed. The precipitate was washed with water three times and centrifuged to remove unreacted sta rting material. Infrared spectrum and PXRD confirmed it was not the required product.",comprehensive synthesis
"Method  D Cage 2 (50 mg, 1 equiv), Zn(NO 3).6H 2O (67mg, 4 equiv) and deoxygenated water (2 mL) was taken in a 10 mL  vial and heated with a hot air until all the reactants dissolve under carbon di oxide  (1 bar) atmosphere. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool under carbon dioxide a white precipitate  was observed within 10-15 min and the reaction was kept under carbon dioxide atmosphere for 1  hour for reaction completion. T he reaction mixture was centrifuged and the supernatant liquid was removed. The precipitate was washed with water three times and centrifuged to remove unreacted starting material. The precipitate was air dried afforded a white microcrystalline powder (52 mg, 43  % yield ).",comprehensive synthesis
Ion-Exchange Experiment  Compound 3 was stirred in a saturated potassium chloride solution for 16 hours. The precipitate was centrifuged and the supernatant liquid was removed. The precipitate was washed with water six times and centrifuged to remove excess KCl and exchanged anions.,comprehensive synthesis
The precipitate was then dried.,comprehensive synthesis
"Figure S22. The surface area of the ion -exchanged cage -MOF was determined by gas sorption analysis. This was performe d using nitrogen adsorption and desorption at 77.3 K on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 volumetric adsorption analyzer, and the surface area was calculated as a 5 point BET measurement. The sample was degassed by heating under vacuum at 10 °„C/min to 60 °„C, holdi ng at 60 °„C for 2 hours, and then heating again at 10 °„C/min up to 90 °„C before holding at 90 °„C for 6 hours under dynamic vacuum.  5 point BET surface area was calculated to be 8.03 m2/g (°¿0.24 m2/g), essentially non -porous.",surface area
