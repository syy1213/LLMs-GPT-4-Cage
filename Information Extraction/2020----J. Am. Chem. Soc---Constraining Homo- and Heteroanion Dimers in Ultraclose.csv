Color codes: carbon,gray; nitrogen, blue; hydrogen, white; chlorine, green; bromine,brown. Disordered solvent molecules, PF6?counterions, andhydrogen atoms which are not involved in hydrogen bondinginteractions are omitted for clarity. Disorder occurs in the case ofCl??36+﹞5PF6?and Br??36+﹞5PF6?. In both cases, the anion guestsare observed to reside in both the primary and secondary binding siteswith relative occupancies of ca. 75% and 25%, respectively. In panels dand f, close contacts are observed between the anionic guests and thecorresponding proximal protons in the cage, including d1= 2.8 ?, d2=2.3 ?, d3= 2.3 ?, d4= 2.8 ?, d5= 3.5 ?, d6= 3.5 ?, d7= 3.0 ?, d8= 2.2?,d9= 2.3 ?, d10= 2.9 ?, d11= 3.4 ?, d12= 3.4 ?.

"23+?3Br?: 4-Pyridinecarboxaldehyde (1.50 g, 14 mmol) and 1,3,5-tri(bromomethyl) benzene (500 mg, 1.4 mmol) were dissolved in 100 mL of acetonitrile and heated at reflux for 48 hours. The resulting precipitate was collected via filtration and washed with hot acetonitrile (3 x 20 mL) to give the product 23??3Br? (922 mg, 90 %) as a white powder.",comprehensive synthesis
"Cl??36+?5PF 6?: Precursors 13??3Br? (100 mg, 0.12 mmol) and 23??3Br? (82 mg, 0.12 mmol) were combined in 50 mL of water. Concentrated HCl (1 mL) was then added. The reaction mixture was heated at 70 oC for 12 h. After cooling, excess of NH 4??PF 6? was added until no further precipitation was observed. The solid obtained in this way was filtrated and washed with water (3 ? 10 mL). Chromatographic purification was then performed over silica gel to improve the purity of 36+ using a 12:7:1 (by volume) mixture of NH 4??Cl? (2 M in water), MeOH and MeNO 2 as the eluent. The fraction containing 36+ was collected and the solvent was evaporated, followed by adding an aqueous solution of NH 4??PF 6? to effect counterion exchange. Under these conditions, the monoanionic complex Cl??36+?5PF 6? precipitates out as a yellow solid. Cl??36+?5PF 6? was collected by filtration (97 mg, 50 %) and fully characterized by recording its 1H NMR spectrum (Figure S11), 13C NMR spectrum (Figure S12), DEPT-135 spectrum (Figure S13), 1H-1H COSY spectrum (Figure S14), HSQC spectrum (Figure S15), HMBC spectrum (Figure S16), as well as via mass spectrometry (Figure S17) and single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (Figure S63).",comprehensive synthesis
