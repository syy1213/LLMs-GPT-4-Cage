"5﹜Section S2 : Synthesis and characterization  Synthesis of TpOMe -CDA  (?) : At first 1,3,5 trimethoxy benzene (TpOMe, 2 mmol, 504 mg) was taken in  a round bottom flask and then 20 ml of ethyl acetate was added into it. The solution was placed in an ice bath followed by slow addition (~1ml/5min) of (1R, 2R) 1,2 -diamino cyclohexane (CDA, 3 mmol, 342 mg) solubilised in 20 ml of DCM. During the addition temperature should be maintained at near to 00 C. A catalytic amount (~5 ?L) of TFA was ad ded after the complete addition. After that , reaction mixture was allowed to keep undisturbed at 20  0C under the condition of slow evaporation. After 48 hrs blocked shaped S4  crystals were appeared at the bottom of the round bottom flask which was collected, washed with ethanol  (Yield 708 mg, 96%) . The yield of the TpOMe -CDA  crystals largely depends on the choice of the solvent and the reaction conditions. This can be rationalized by the variable solubility and the reactivity of the starting materials in diffe rent solvents. If the temperature is not maintained close to 0 ? C, during the addition, reaction occurs at a faster rate and the yield reduces. In the absence of TFA, the reaction takes longer time for its completion and is also associated with lower yield. Instead of DCM: EtOAc (1:1) mixtures if only DCM is used then  also yield of the TpOMe -CDA  crystals reduce  significantly. These crystals were not shape persistent and after a few minutes of keeping at ambient atmosphere it got cracked which were found to be not suitable for diffraction. Finally good quality single crystals suitable for diffraction were obtained after recrystallising in (1:1) mixture of chloroform and acetonitrile . 1H NMR (CDCl 3): ? 8.53 (s, 12H), 3.54 (s, 36H), 3.41  (s, 12H) , 1.48-1.82 (m, 48 H) ppm.  13C NMR  (CDCl 3): ? 162, 153, 120, 62, 33, 24 ppm.  Mass of TpOMe -CDA  (C84N12O12H108) was confirmed by MALDI/TOF ([M+H]+ 1477.8288 and observed 1477.9869).
