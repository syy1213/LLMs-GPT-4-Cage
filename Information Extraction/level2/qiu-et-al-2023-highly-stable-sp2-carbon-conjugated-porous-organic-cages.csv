Inspired by highly stable sp2carbon-conjugated (C=C) covalent organic frame-works, we used rational design and synthesizedthe?rst family of sp2carbon-linked POCs (sp2c-POCs) with triangular prism shapes by a one-stepKnoevenagel reaction that is a high yield [2+3] con-densation reaction. The stability of sp2c-POC wasdemonstrated under strenuous conditions involvingfor example concentrated HCl or saturated NaOHsolution. sp2c-POC was used as a robust adsorbentfor ef ?cient separation of CO 2/CH 4or CO 2/N2mixtures. In view of their facile synthesis and uniqueproperties, we expect w idespread use of thesesp2C=C linkages in the development of POCmaterials.",affiliation

Fourier transform infrared (FT -IR) spectra were recorded in the range 4000?400 cm?1 with a Magna 750 FT -IR spectrometer using KBr pellets. 1H NMR spectra were obtained on a Burker AVANCE 400 (400 MHz) for spectrometer. T hermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out under a dynamic N 2 flow on a NETZSCH STA 449C thermal analyzer by heating samples from 30 to 900 ¡ã C. X -ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured on a Thermo ESCALAB 250 spectrometer.

The SCXRD analysis revealed thatsp2c-POC1 crystallizes in a monoclinic system with spacegroup P-21c and has a distorted triangular prism structurewith two molecules of i-Bu-C3CHO acting as planes withheight (the distance between the centers of oppositearomatic rings) of 1.15 nm and three Me-BDN moleculesacting as the edges (Figure 1d). Interestingly, the linkageinsp2c-POC1 is the sp2C=C bond, and its backbonetherefore contains only carbon atoms. To the best of ourknowledge, POCs with pure carbon atom backbones areuncommon,31and most such POCs reported so far aresynthesized by kinetic bond formation and alkynemetathesis reactions, which are accompanied by pro-blems involving expensive catalysts and/or low productyields.25,55,56Further inspecting the structure of sp2c-POC1revealed that its backbone is comprised of all sp2carbons,which suggests that Knoevenagel reaction is an effectiveway to prepare fully sp2c¦Ð-conjugated cages. Althoughseveral methods, such as Wittig reaction, Suzuki ¨CMiyauracross-couplings together with acid-mediated reductivearomatization, and reductive elimination of the platinumfrom the coordination cage, have been reported, but theyrequire low-yielding multistep synthesis under tough con-ditions.57¨C59The intrinsic void diameter and average diam-eter of the circular window of the cage reported by thepyWINDOW program are ¡«5.6 and ¡«4.8 ?, respectively.",CCDC

The calculatedlargest pore diameter and pore limiting diameter is 5.6and 4.1 ?, respectively, by Zeo++ software with a probewith a radius of 1.82 ? in the solid-state structure. Theanalyses of the crystalline void of sp2c-POC1 by Mercurysoftware and placing a probe of N 2with kinetic radius of1.82 ? revealed that 22% of the unit cell volume is emptyspace large enough to hold gas molecules ( SupportingInformation Figure S24 ). Moreover, we also exploredwhether the reticular chemistry can be applied in con-struction of sp2c-POCs. Thus, the longer ditopic V-shapeddiacetonitriles linkers were used in reacting with i-Bu-C3CHO, which directly produced the corresponding larg-er [2+3] sp2c-POC2 (CCDC No. 2225780) with intrinsicvoid diameter, height, and cavity volume increased to1.2 nm, 1.7 nm, and 566 ?3, respectively (Figure 1e).

Before measurements, sp2c-POC  powder samples were packed into a custom -made stainless -steel column (3.0 mm I.D.¡Á 120 mm) with silica wool filling the void space and was activated through sample hea ting at 100 ¡ã C with a constant flow of He (10 mL min-1) at room temperature and pressure.

By means of mass spectrometer, outlet effluent from the column was continuously monitored.

"The intrinsic cavity space of sp2c-POCs prompted us toexamine their gas adsorption properties. The sp2c-POCsshowed negligible N 2adsorption capacity ( SupportingInformation Figure S29 ) mainly because N 2moleculescannot diffuse through the narrow pores into their cavitiesat such cryogenic temperatures. Thus, we used CO 2ad-sorption at 196 K as an alternative method to probe theirporosity.64This phenomenon is relatively common in po-rous molecular organic materials, such as hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks, supramolecular organicframeworks, and POCs.65¨C67Their 196 K CO 2saturationcapacities ranged from 68.7 to 152.3 cm3g?1, giving acorresponding calculated Brunauer ¨CEmmett ¨CTeller (BET)surface area ranging from 185 to 350 m2g¨C1(Figure 3aandSupporting Information Figures S30 ¨CS34). Notably, sp2c-POC1 exhibited the highest BET surface area among thesesp2c-POCs, suggesting the solid-state packing has a largein?uence on their surface areas ( Supporting InformationFigures S24 ¨CS28 and Table S5 ). In terms of the mostuseful gas adsorption property, sp2c-POC1 was selectedas a representative to study its sorption of various gasesat different temperatures, as well as analytical applica-tions. At 298 K and 100 kPa, sp2c-POC1 absorbed signi ?-cant quantities of gases with the exception of N 2,w i t huptake capacities of 27.4 and 6.1 cm3g?1for CO 2and CH 4(Figure 3b), respectively. Moreover, it absorbed about35 cm3g?1of C2 hydrocarbons at 273 K and 100 kPa(Supporting Information Figure S36 ). These sorption dataare comparable to those derived from the reported POMswith narrow pores.68Notably, the CO 2uptake capacitiesofsp2c-POC1 were much higher than those of theconcave-shaped aromatic trialdehyde precursor, whoseCO2uptake is only about 1.1 cm3g?1(Supporting Infor-mation Figure S37 ). This result reveals that bridging mo-lecular synthons with intrinsic cavities leading into cagescan possess highly enhanced gas storage abilities. More-over, the gas sorption isotherms of CO 2,C H 4,a n dN 2at273 K were investigated to calculate the correspondingisosteric heat of adsorption ( Qst) values for these gases(Supporting Information Figures S38 ¨CS41).",surface area

"Experimental MethodsThe phenylacetonitriles, organic solvents, and inorganicand organic bases obtained from commercial sourceswere employed without further puri ?cation. The longerditopic V-shaped diacetonitriles were prepared by Suzukicross-coupling reactions between substituted 1,3-dibro-mobenzene and 2-(4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxabor-olan-2-yl)phenyl)acetonitrile. The substituted aromatictrialdehydes were synthesized through 1,3,5-tris(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzene and relatedsubstituted 3-bromobenzaldehydes by Suzuki reactions(Supporting Information Figures S4 ¨CS15). All sp2c-POCcrystals can be directly obtained through Knoevenagelcondensation between substituted aromatic trialdehydes(1 equiv) and diacetonitriles (1.5 equiv) with Cs 2CO3ascatalyst and common organic solvents such as tetrahy-drofuran (THF), methanol (MeOH), and toluene, by sol-vothermal method.
