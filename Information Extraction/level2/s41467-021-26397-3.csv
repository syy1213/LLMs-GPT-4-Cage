"Conformer-1 and -2, with different cleft positions and sizes. Aided by molecular dynamicssimulations, we select two triamino conformation capturers (denoted CC). Small-sized CC-1 selectively capture Conformer-1 by matching its cleft size, while the large-sized CC-2 is ableto match and capture both conformers. This strategy allows the formation of three com-pounds with twin cavities, which we coin diphane. The self-assembly of diphane units resultsin superstructures with tunable proton conductivity, which reaches up to 1.37℅10-5Sc m-1.https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-26397-3 OPEN1School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Frontiers Science Center for Transformative Molecules, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 800 Dongchua nRoad, 200240 Shanghai, China.2School of Physical Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, 393 Huaxia Middle Road, 200120 Shanghai, China.",affiliation

"S23 The difference of thermodynamic stability of all diphanes were also studied by DFT calculation (B3LYP-D3 in PCM with chloroform as solvent), which is summarized in Supplementary Fig. 11. The strain energy (SE), torsion angle and relative configuration energy were computed to evaluate the possibility of forming a cage structure. SE is defined as the energy difference between the conformer in the cage and the optimized free conformer. It should be noted the end group of the conformers in the cage was reduced to aldehyde structures to maintain the equality of the calculations. The SE of exo-[1,2,4]diphane is the highest with 102.13 kJ mol-1, larger than 96.38 kJ mol-1 for endo-[1,2,4]diphane, and exo-[1,2,4]diphane is significantly bent with the smallest torsion angle of t4 = 174.12o, smaller than 175.04o for endo-[1,2,4]diphane. When using the large-sized CC-2, the SE values of the resulting diphanes are considerably lower, with 67.33 kJ mol-1 for endo-[1,2,5]diphane, and 77.00 kJ mol-1 for exo-[1,2,5]diphane, respectively, echoed with their corresponding torsion angles. The SE difference between endo-[1,2,4]diphane and exo-[1,2,4]diphane therefore presumably leads to the formation of the former as the major product. Considering no formation of exo-[1,2,4]diphane was observed while its SE is only slightly higher than that of endo-[1,2,4]diphane, we assume that a threshould effect might play a significant role that determines the formation of diphanes in the current study. The tendency of SE and torsion angle for endo-[1,2,4]diphane vs. exo-[1,2,4]diphane and endo-[1,2,5]diphane vs. exo-[1,2,5]diphane is also in line with that of their corresponding configuration energy, as the calculated results showed that endo-[1,2,4]diphane is 51.02 kJ/mol more stable than exo-[1,2,4]diphane, and endo-[1,2,5]diphane is 23.86 kJ/mol more stable than exo-[1,2,5]diphane. All the calculated results correlate well with the experimental yields obtained for the resulting diphanes.   S24 7.

Tetrahydrofuran was dried over sodium/benzophenone under nitrogen atmosphere before use. The reaction evolution was monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and flash column chromatography was performed on silica gel (200-300 mesh) with indicated eluent. 2. Techniques 2.1 Solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Advance ｋ HD (400/500 MHz) NMR spectrometer at room temperature. Proton and carbon chemical shift values (汛) and coupling constants (J) are reported in ppm and Hertz (Hz) respectively. The resonance multiplicity of the 1H NMR spectra are denoted as ※s§ (single), ※d§ (doublet), ※t§ (triplet), ※quint§ (quintet), ※m§ (multiplet) and broad resonances are described as ※br§. Residual protic solvent of CDCl3 (1H, 汛 = 7.26 ppm; 13C, 汛 = 77.16 ppm), (CD3)2SO (1H, 汛 = 2.50 ppm; 13C, 汛 = 39.52 ppm), CD2Cl2 (1H, 汛 = 5.32 ppm; 13C, 汛 = 53.84 ppm), CD3OD (1H, 汛 = 3.31 ppm; 13C, 汛 = 49.00 ppm) were used as the internal standard in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra. S4 2.2 Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) Solid-state 1H MAS single-pulse and DQ/SQ spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE  NE O 600 MHz, 3.2 mm rotor, MAS of 15 MHz, recycle delay of 5 sec. 2.3 Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Paragon 1000 spectrometer at frequencies ranging from 4000 to 500 cm-1 at room temperature. The signal intensity was denoted as ※s§ (strong), ※m§ (medium), ※w§ (weak) and ※br§ (broad). 2.4 Matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) Matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was performed on a solariX XR 7.0 T hybrid quadrupole-FTICR mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI/APCI/MALDI ion source (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The MS instrument was tuned and calibrated with ESI-L low concentration tuning mix (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and sodium formate. The analytical sample was prepared by mixing the reaction mixture (2.0 mg/mL in CHCl3) with the matrix solution (10 mg/mL DCTB in CHCl3) in a v/v ratio of 1/5, and then loaded onto the MALDI plate. The sample on the plate was thoroughly dried prior to analysis. The mass spectra were analyzed using Compass Data Analysis 5.0 (Bruker). 2.5 Single crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD)  The crystals were kept at 170.0 K during data collection. Using Olex24, the structures were solved with the SHELXT5 structure solution program using Intrinsic Phasing and refined with the SHELXL6 refinement package using Least Squares minimisation. Some solvent molecules were highly disordered and could not be reasonably located. The voids in the crystal lattice were treated with Platon squeeze program. S5 2.6 Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) The detailed procedure of sample preparation for PXRD measurements are as follows: The as-synthesized bulk powder samples of diphanes were firstly dispersed in distilled THF solvent with a concentration at 30 mg/mL, followed by sonication until thorough dispersion. Additional TFA was then added until the mixture became clear, which was subsequently subjected to filtration with 0.45 米m PTFE springe filter to remove the undissolved residue. Slow evaporation of the settled solution yielded high-quality single crystals, which were then loaded into a quartz glass capillary with a diameter of 0.7 mm without mother liquor. PXRD data were collected at ambient temperature with a capillary setup. 2.7 High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) HPCL analysis were performed on a Shimadzu LC-20 AD instrument at room temperature using a Daicel Chiralcel IA column. The elution was employed within 60 min with 18% CHCl3 in ethanol containing 0.5% diethylamine of total volume at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The sample concentration was 5.0 mM in methanol, and the injection volume was 10 米L. The absorbance of endo-[1,2,4]diphane was monitored at 254 nm, endo-[1,2,5]diphane and exo-[1,2,5]diphane were monitored at 298 nm. S6 3. Synthesis 3.1 Synthesis route of model molecule 1  Supplementary Fig. 1 Synthesis route of model compound 1. 1,4-Phenylenebis(diphenylmethanol) (1a): The phenyllithium solution (51.4 mL, 51.0 mmol, 5.0 equiv., 1.0 M in ether) in anhydrous THF (70.0 mL) was cooled to -78 ⊥ under argon atmosphere. Into the mixture was added dropwise the solution of dimethyl terephthalate (2.0 g, 10.3 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) in anhydrous THF (25.0 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred for another 0.5 h at -78 ⊥ and then allowed to warm to room temperature for 24 h. Then, the reaction was quenched with a sat. aqueous NH4Cl solution (50.0 mL), and THF was removed by rotary evaporator. The reaction was extracted with DCM (3℅40.0 mL), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and concentrated to give the crude product. Purification by flash column chromatography (Hex/DCM = 1:3 v/v, as eluent) afforded the title compound 1a (4.1 g, 91%) as a white solid. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3), 汛 = 7.33 (m, 24H), 2.86 (s, 2H). 13C NMR (101 MHz, CDCl3), 汛 = 146.81, 145.88, 128.06, 128.00, 127.68, 127.41, 81.99.",this paper's author
