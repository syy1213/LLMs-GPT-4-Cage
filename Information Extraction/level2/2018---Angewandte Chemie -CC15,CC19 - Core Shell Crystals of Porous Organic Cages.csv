"Cage synthesis: CC3, CC15 and CC19  were all reporte d previously .[1]  CC3 synthesis: CC3-R was synthesized by the condensation reaction of 1, 3, 5 -triformylbenzene ( TFB) and (1 R, 2R)-(-)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane ( R, R-CHDA) in DCM at room temperature. TFB (400 mg, 2.47 mmol) was dissolved in DCM (20 ml) and added to a solution of R,R-CHDA (422 mg, 3.70mmol) in DCM (20 ml). After 5 每7 days, crystals were formed and isolated to obtain white powders with a yield of 70%. The synth esis of CC3-S was identical to that of CC3-R, apart from the use of the (1S, 2S)-(-)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane (S,S-CHDA) .",comprehensive synthesis
"CC19  synthesis: for CC19 -R, DCM (50 mL) was added to 2 -hydroxy -1,3,5 -benzenetricarbaldehyde (50 mg, 0.31 mmol) in a round bottom flask a t room temperature.",comprehensive synthesis
"After 5 minutes, a solution of R,R-CHDA (34 mg, 0.47 mmol) in MeOH (5 mL) was added. The resulting mixture was left covered for 3 每5 days with stirring. A yellow powders, CC19 -R, was obtained by slow evaporation with a yield of 78 %. Crystals were obtained by dissolving the CC19 -R powder in CHCl 3 solution and the crystals can be isolated over several days with slow evaporation at room temperature. The opposite cage enantiomer was  formed from S,S-CHDA.",comprehensive synthesis
"CC15 -S synthesis: a solution of S,S-CHDA (4.28 g, 37.5 mmol) in DCM (50 mL) was added to 1,3,5 -triacetylbenzene (TAB)  (5.10 g, 25.0 mmol) and molecular sieves (1 g, 3 ?), giving a yellow suspension. The flask was equipped with revers e Dean -Stark apparatus, which was charged with DCM, and the solution was heated to 45 ∼C with stirring for 24 h.",comprehensive synthesis
Approximately 0.7 mL of water was collected in the Dean -Stark apparatus.  The reaction was then cooled to room temperature and filtered by gra vity to remove the molecular sieves.,comprehensive synthesis
"The resulting pale yellow solution was evaporated to yield a pale yellow solid (92% crude yield), which was recrystallized from DCM/hexane (1:1) to yield white needle -like crystals.",comprehensive synthesis
"Cage core -shell synthesis: In the pr evious study, Hasell et al . described a method for fabrication of racemic cage nanoparticles using chiral recognition when mixing the cage molecule with an opposite chirality.[2] Core -shell morphologies were achieved using an adapted version of this procedure via the growth of the race mic (or quasiracemic) cage shell in the presence of the core crystals, which act as seeds. All synthetic details are described in the main manuscript.  CC3-RScore/CC19 -RSshell core -shell crystals with a particle size of < 1 米m: 1 equivalent CC3-R DCM solution (2 mg/ml, 1 ml) was prepared, and 1 equivalent of CC3-S DCM solution (2 mg/ml, 1 ml) was added into the CC3-R solution using a syringe pump with a rate of mixing of 5 ml/h. The mixed the solution was left over 4 h to form the racemic core crystals. Once the core crystals were formed, 1 equivalent CC19 -R DCM solution (2.1 mg/ml, 1 ml) and 1 equivalent of CC19 -S (2.1 mg/ml, 1ml) were added using a syringe pump to form the racemic shell. The preparation was carried out at 30 ∼C. The as -prepared solution was slowly evaporated to obtain the core -shell crystals as a powder.",comprehensive synthesis
"CC3-RScore/CC19 -RSshell core -shell crystals wi th a particle size of 3 每4 米m: 1 equivalent CC3-R CHCl 3 solution (8 mg/ml, 1 ml) was prepared, and 1 equivalent of CC3-S CHCl 3 solution (8 mg/ml, 1 ml) was added into the CC3-R solution using a syringe pump with a rate of mixing of 5 ml/h. The mixed solutio n was left over 4 h to form the racemic core crystals. Once the core crystals were formed, 1 equivalent CC19 -R CHCl 3 solution (8.5 mg/ml, 1 ml) and 1 equivalent of CC19 -S (8.5 mg/ml, 1ml) were added using a syringe pump to form the racemic shell. The prepa ration was carried out at 50 ∼C, which led to larger particle sizes (c.f., preparation above at 30 ∼C). The as -prepared solution was slowly evaporated to obtain the core -shell crystals as a powder. The synthesis of CC3-RScore/CC19 -RSshell core -shell crysta ls with a particle size of 5 每6 米m for confocal microscopy studies was identical to that of core -shell crystals with particle size of 3 -4 米m, apart from the preparation carried out in CHCl 3 at 60 ∼C.",comprehensive synthesis
A similar synthetic procedure was applied for the inverse  CC19 -RScore/CC3-RSshell core -shell crystals; the components were simply added in the reverse order.,comprehensive synthesis
"CC3-RScore/CC15 S-CC3Rshell core -shell crystals with a particle size of 3 米m: 1 equivalent CC3-R DCM solution (2 mg/ml, 1 ml) was prepared, and 1 equivalent of CC3-S DCM solution (2 mg/ml, 1 ml) was added into the CC3-R solution using a syringe pump with a rate of mixing of 5 ml/h. The mixed the solution was left over 4 h to form the quasiracemic cor e crystals.",comprehensive synthesis
"Once the core crystals were formed, 1 equivalent CC3-R DCM solution (2 mg/ml, 1 ml) and 1 equivalent of CC15 -S (2.3 mg/ml, 1ml) were added using a syringe pump to form shell -cocrystals The preparation was carried out at 30 ∼C. The as -prepared s olution was slowly evaporated to obtain the core -shell crystals as a powder.",comprehensive synthesis
