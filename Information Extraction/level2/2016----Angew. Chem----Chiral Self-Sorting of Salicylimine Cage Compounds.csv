"[8a,f]Nonetheless, the prepara-tion of a racemic mixture of a homochiral [4 +6] imine cagecompound has been reported by Cooper et al. by mixingequimolar amounts of the enantiopure cage compounds CC3-Rand CC3-S, which were obtained by the condensationbetween 1,3,5-triformyl benzene and ( R,R)-1,2-diamino-cyclohexane or ( S,S)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane.[10]Interest-ingly, this racemic mixture ( CC3-R,S) behaves differentlythan its enantiopure counterpart in gas sorption: the enantio-pure [4 +6] imine cage CC3-Rwas reported with a specificsurface area of 624 m2g/C01(Brunauer-Emmett-Teller model,BET) while the racemic mixture of cages CC3-R,Shasa specific surface area between 507®C873 m2g/C01, depending onits crystallization conditions.[10,11]Recently it was reportedthat CC3-related [4 +6] imine cages constructed by usingracemic trans -1,2-cyclohexanediamine showed improvedchemical stability against SO2and water.[8a]However, theexact composition of this cage mixture is not known and itwould be beneficial to synthesize homochiral organic cages ina more controlled fashion.",surface area

The difference between ( M,M)-3andrac-3is farlarger than the one between CC3-Rand CC3-R,Smeasuredby Cooper et al. and illustrates how even small structuralchanges can lead to large differences in the surface area ofmicroporous materials.

"The reaction between triamine ( +)-(M)-1and 2was firstcarried out in [D8]THF with a catalytic amount of TFA. The1H NMR spectrum of the reaction mixture showed theformation of sharp signals expected for the formation of thecage compound ( M,M)-3along with broad signals likelyarising from ill-defined oligomeric products (Figure 1A).(M,M)-3was purified from this mixture by precipitation withn-pentane (Figure 1B). When ( /C6)-1was used instead, twoimine-derived signals at d=8.35 and 8.39 ppm in a 76:24 ratiowere observed in the1H NMR spectrum of the reactionmixture (Figure 1C). The major isomer was also purified byprecipitation with n-pentane, and was found to be spectro-scopically identical to ( M,M)-3(Figure 1D). This findinginferred that narcissistic self-sorting leading to a racemicmixture of the homochiral cage compounds ( M,M)-3and(P,P)-3was favored, which was further confirmed by theresolution of its crystal structure (see Figure 3; see discussionbelow). Mass spectrometry analysis (MALDI-TOF) of thecrude reaction mixture suggested that the minor isomer wasthe heterochiral cage compound ( M,P)-4and not a larger[*] Dr. D. Beaudoin, Dr. F.

"Abstract: An inherently chiral C3-symmetric triaminotriben-zotriquinacene was condensed in racemic and enantiomeri-cally pure form with a bis(salicylaldehyde) to form [2+3]salicylimine cage compounds. Investigations on the chiral self-sorting revealed that while entropy favors narcissistic self-sorting in solution, selective social self-sorting can be achievedby exploiting the difference in solubility between the homo-chiral and heterochiral cages. Gas sorption measurementsfurther showed that seemingly small structural differences canhave a significant impact on the surface area of microporouscovalent cage compounds.",topology
"As a part of our ongoing research on porous salicyliminecage compounds,[11]we investigated whether chiral self-sorting could be efficiently achieved by using racemic buildingblocks to construct them by DCC. To do so, we studied thecondensation of inherently chiral C3-symmetric triamino-tribenzotriquinacene 1[12]with bis(salicylaldehyde) 2(Scheme 1). The smallest unstrained cage compounds whichcan result from this condensation are the homochiral [2 +3]cage compound 3and the heterochiral [2 +3] cage compound4.",topology

"Indeed, the same ratio that was previouslyobserved for the crude reaction mixture wasagain witnessed (see the Supporting Informa-tion). Semiempirical calculations (PM3) werethen performed to gain insight on the factors that favor theformation of the homochiral cages rac-3over the heterochiralcage ( M,P)-4in solution. A very small difference in enthalpysuggests the formation ( M,P)-4over ( M,M)-3to be favoredby only 0.62 kJmol/C01.
