"bSSupporting Information¡¯INTRODUCTIONMicroporous materials ¡ªthat is, materials with pores smallerthan 2 nm ¡ªhave generated much recent interest.1/C05Recently,porous solids of entirely organic composition have extendedthe range of possible properties and applications. Microporousand mesoporous organic polymers6/C011and covalent organicframeworks (COFs),12,13in particular, have scope for targetedapplications because their constituent building blocks can bereadily diversi ?ed using organic synthesis.14The surface area insuch networks is generated typically via templating or sca ?oldingapproaches;15/C018as such, the porosity is a consequence of thesolid state packing of the building blocks and is ¡®extrinsic ¡¯innature. Other organic materials can exhibit ¡®intrinsic ¡¯porositythat results from the shape of the isolated molecular buildingblocks themselves, for example in the form of syntheticallyprefabricated pores, cavities, or windows. Examples of such ¡®porousmolecules,19,20include calixarenes21,22and a range of other smallorganic molecules with shape-persistent covalent cavities.23/C025C a g e - l i k em o l e c u l e sa r ea p p e a l i n ga sp o r o u ss o l i d s .27/C029Re-cently, a family of porous organic cage compounds has beenshown to demonstrate either extrinsic or intrinsic porosity, depend-ing on the packing mode of the cages.30/C034The cavities andwindows in these molecules are created by a reversible [4 + 6]Schi?-base condensation29,35of amine and aldehyde compo-nents. Notably, packing of these cages ¡ªand hence the porosityof the resulting crystalline solids ¡ªis in?uenced by the bulkinessof the cage vertices.30The materials have permanent microporestructures and exhibit Brunauer /C0Emmett /C0Teller surface areas(SA BET)o fu pt o6 2 4m2g/C01for smaller cages30and >1300 m2g/C01for a larger [4 + 6] imine cage.32,33In principle, intrinsically porousorganic cages may have advantages over networks and frameworksbecause they are solution processable and can be combined in amodular fashion to generate porous cocrystals comprising morethan one molecular building block.33In general, porous molecular crystals may be expected to havegreater scope for structural rearrangement and polymorphismthan crystalline porous frameworks, such as zeolites, MOFs, andCOFs. This is because molecular organic crystals are assembledvia weaker and less directional noncovalent forces in comparisonwith covalent and coordination frameworks. This can be anadvantage or a disadvantage, depending on the context. Forexample, we have exploited the ¡®soft¡¯5nature of porous molecularcrystals in the preparation of materials with ¡®on/o?¡¯porosityswitching behavior.31Such structural ?exibility, however, mightalso prove undesirable in other cases and lead to irreversible lossof porosity. Moreover, even with the prospect of methods forpredicting molecular crystal structures,33,36the modular andpredictable assembly of multicomponent porous organic crystalsassembled via noncovalent forces remains a major challenge.Hence, to achieve programmed assembly in porous molecularcrystals, as demonstrated in isoreticular MOFs,37it is desirable touse the established tools of crystal engineering and supramole-cular chemistry to direct molecular assembly.38For example,Received: July 1, 2011ABSTRACT: Control over pore size, shape, and connectivity in synthetic porousmaterials is important in applications su ch as separation, storage, and catalysis.",surface area
"Typically, porosity is either ¡®intrinsic ¡¯(within the molecules) or ¡®extrinsic ¡¯(betweenthe molecules) ¡ªbut not both. We report a supramolecular approach to the assemblyof porous organic cages which involves bulky di recting groups that frustrate the crystalpacking. This generates, in a synthetically designed fashion, additional ¡®extrinsic ¡¯porosity between the intrinsically porous cage units. One of the molecular crystalsexhibits an apparent Brunauer /C0Emmett/C0Teller surface area of 854 m2g/C01,w h i c hi shigher than that of unfunctionalized ca ges of the same dimensions. Moreover,connectivity between pores, and hence guest uptakes, can be modulated by theintroduction of halogen bonding motifs in the cage modules. This suggests a broaderapproach to the supramolecular engineering o f porosity in molecular organic crystals.",surface area
"Nitrogen and hydrogen sorption isotherms were collected at 77 K; carbon dioxide adsorption isotherms at 273 K. The derived Langmuir surface areafrom the adsorption isotherm for CC9 (R3),CC9 (P3) and CC10 is 575 m2g/C01(SA BET= 501 m2g/C01), 952 m2g/C01(SA BET= 854 m2g/C01) and 533 m2g/C01(SA BET= 460 m2g/C01), respectively. Comparison of micropore size distributions for CC9 (R3) ()),CC9 (P3) (0), and CC10 (O) as calculatedusing nonlocal density functional theory (D).",surface area
"The desolvated molecular solids for CC9 (both polymorphs)andCC10 adsorb large quantities of gases. The Langmuir surfaceareas calculated from the Type I nitrogen sorption isothermswere 952 m2g/C01(SA BET= 854 m2g/C01) for CC9 (P3), 575 m2g/C01(SA BET= 501 m2g/C01) for CC9 (R3), and 533 m2g/C01(SA BET= 460 m2g/C01)f o r CC10 (Figure 5). Pore size distribu-tions calculated by nonlocal density functional theory from theadsorption branches show two main peaks in the microporeregion for each of these materials. The set of smaller pore sizes iscomparable with the static diameters of the windows of indivi-dual cage molecules of approximately 6 ?. All materials werereanalyzed after gas-sorption analysis by powder X-ray di ?rac-tion, and the obtained data was re ?ned against the crystalstructures of the desolvated materials to ensure that no chemi-cal decomposition or permanent structural rearrangement hadaccompanied the degassing or sorption processes. The nitrogenuptake at 77 K for both CC9 (R3) and CC10 amounts to7.5 mmol g/C01, while the P3 polymorph of CC9 adsorbs almosttwice as much gas (14.3 mmol g/C01). Both of the CC9 poly-morphs show classical Type I nitrogen sorption behavior, whilethe isotherm for CC10 is hysteretic almost over the entirepressure range. Similarly, CC9 (R3) and CC10 absorb 3.5 mmolg/C01(0.70 wt %) and 3.6 mmol g/C01(0.73 wt %) of hydrogen at77 K, while CC9 (P3) shows a larger uptake of 4.8 mmol g/C01(0.96 wt %). At higher temperatures (273 K), the three cagestructures adsorb more similar quantities of CO 2: 1.9 mmol g/C01forCC9 (R3), 2.0 mmol g/C01forCC9 (P3), and 1.6 mmol g/C01forCC10 . To put these results into perspective, the crystallineporous solid CC9 (P3) has a higher apparent surface area andadsorbs more N 2than any of the comparably sized cages that wereported initially,30although it is surpassed by two larger cagesreported recently, one by Mastalerz32and one by our own group.33As such, our strategy of producing additional, extrinsic pore volumevia the introduction of bulkier vertices is successful, at least for CC9(P3), as evidenced both by crystallography and gas sorptionanalysis. It should be noted here that gas sorption in solids suchas this cannot always be justi ?ed by crystal structures alone. Forexample, crystalline defects and surface barriers may in ?uencesorption, and these are not captured by X-ray crystallography.54,55Moreover, any amorphized impurities, which might be ¡®invisible ¡¯toX-ray methods, could contribute to, rather than reduce, the porevolume in these solids.56As outlined above, only a minor rotation of the relevant arylgroups about a C /C0C bond is ¡®gating ¡¯the pore connectivitybetween the intrinsic and extrinsic porosity in CC9. Thus,it is possible that low-energy cooperative dynamic processesmay occur at more elevated temperatures involving transientrotation of these groups, perhaps explaining the smaller di ?er-ence in CO 2sorption observed between the two CC9 poly-morphs (Figure 5).30,57¡¯CONCLUSIONSTo conclude, the vertex functionality in these new cageswas chosen to enhance porosity with respect to our previousmaterials30by creating additional, extrinsic porosity to augmentthe intrinsic porosity within the cages. For the P3 polymorph ofCC9, which can be crystallized reproducibly from chloroform,this strategy has succeeded. We have therefore demonstrated apathway toward rational, synthetic design of additional extrinsicporosity within this class of intrinsically porous organic cagemolecules. The vertex groups in CC9 andCC10 were chosen todirect molecular assembly in ways that are familiar in the ?elds ofcrystal engineering and supramolecular chemistry. The porousmolecular crystals obtained show exceptionally high gas uptakeswithin this class of material resulting from a combination ofintrinsic and extrinsic pore volumes. These observations raise thequestion of how we might enhance porosity further in suchmaterials. One design principle would be to develop cage tectonsthat show anisotropic ordering to minimize the potential surfacearea in each molecule that is lost in the form of intermolecularcontacts. That is, we propose to search for tectons that formporous solids comprising, as nearly as possible, ¡®point contacts ¡¯between molecules such that the guest-accessible surface ismaximized. In this respect, hydrogen bonding at ¡®sticky ¡¯func-tionalized vertices is a promising tool.",surface area

"Cages CC9 andCC10 were synthesized by cycloimination of1,3,5-triformylbenzene with ( R,R)-1,2-diphenylethylenediamineand ( R,R)-1,2-bis(4- ?uorophenyl)ethane-1,2-diamine, respec-tively, in dichloromethane using tri ?uoroacetic acid as a catalyst(Figure 1). Under these reaction conditions, cage formationcompetes with a Diaza-Cope rearrangement of the same typeused commonly to synthesize vicinal diamines.39As such, theproduction of the desired [4 + 6] imine cage is challenging, andindeed, a previous study reported that the ( R,R)-1,2-dipheny-lethylenediamine cycloimination reaction does not occur.40Thecompeting Diaza-Cope reaction requires a chair-shaped geome-try to yield the undesirable rearranged side-product (Figure S1,Supporting Information (SI)). The key to producing these cagesin viable yields was to slow down the rate of this rearrangementby cooling the reaction and, for CC10 , to remove the condensa-tion byproduct (water) using drying agents. A detailed account ofthe experimental methods is provided in the SI. After someoptimization, CC9 (1706 g mol/C01) and CC10 (1922 g mol/C01)could be obtained in satisfactory yields of 35% and 37%, respec-tively, which is on a par with the initial, nonoptimized yields re-ported for our ?rst generation of porous cage molecules.",topology
