A conventional synthetic approach for imine-based POCs and COFs usually involves the use oforganic solvents/acid catalysts (such as AcOH or TFA). However, synthesizing and growing POC crystalsand COF crystallites with enhanced crystallinity is not an easy-to-perform process, in which many reac-tion parameters need to be screened. To overcome these problems, we have proposed herein a facileand green synthetic strategy by adopting H2O/organic solvents/MOH (M = Na, K, and Cs) as reactionmedia to produce a series of phenol-based POCs and COFs. X-ray crystallography and molecular simu-lations have been used to con ?rm their structures in addition to NMR, mass and FT-IR spectra, and gassorption experiments reveal their porosity and sorption properties. This new approach provides not onlyan e?cient and alternative route to synthesize highly crystalline POCs and even COFs, but also insightinto the crystallization process of these two kinds of porous materials, especially in the hydrous media.",this paper's author

"Particularly, this method is believed to o ?er an easy ande?cient way to grow single crystals of some POCs and COFson a large scale, which are hard to be obtained using conven-tional methods.Results and discussionSynthesis and characterization of four POC crystalsTo better illustrate our synthetic approach, we have adoptedo-hydroxyaryl arylaldehydes ( 1每3) and 1,3,5-triformylphloroglu-cinol ( Tp) as monomers to construct four POCs and four COFs,respectively. Four POCs were synthesized by the condensationreactions of three o-hydroxyaryl aldehydes ( 1每3) with (1 S,2S)o r(1R,2R)-cyclohexanediamine in [3 + 6], [2 + 4] or [4 + 8] cycloi-mination (Fig. 2). The synthesis was performed in a mixture ofethanol and water in the presence of MOH (M = Na, K, andCs). Firstly, tetraaldehyde and 2 equiv. of KOH were dissolvedin a mixture of EtOH/H2O (in a range of 1 : 1 每3 : 1) and then 2equiv. of (1 S,2S)o r( 1 R,2R)-cyclohexanediamine were added.",topology
"View Article Onlinesingle crystals of NC1-Swere isolated from a mixture ofethanol and water in a yield of 43% (see section S-2 andFig. S27 ?) without any other by-products. Its ESI-MS spectrumshows the [3 + 6] cage structure with a molecular ion peak atm/z= 1364.17 (Fig. S21 ?). Crystallographic analysis shows thatthe [3 + 6] tubular cage of NC1-Scrystallizes in the tetragonalspace group of P43212 (Fig. 2c and Table S-1 ?), which isdi?erent from our previously reported racemic NC1.33Poresize distributions (5.0, 5.7, and 6.5 ?) calculated by non-localdensity functional theory from the Ar sorption analysis of NC1-S(Fig. S40 ?) are consistent with those obtained by their struc-tural measurement (Fig. S32 ?).",topology
"NC2-Rand NC3-Rwere synthesized by a condensation reac-tion between tetraaldehyde 2and (1 R,2R)-cyclohexanediaminein [2 + 4] and [3 + 6] cycloimination in the presence of EtOH/H2O/MOH (M = Na, K, and Cs). They can be directly collectedfrom their respective mother solutions in pure phase by con-trolling the evaporation temperature (see the ESI ?for detailedexperimental methods). NC2-Rwas isolated directly as yellowblock crystals in 35% yield (Fig. S27 ?). It adopts the [2 + 4] con-figuration in which the two tetraaldehyde components arenearly perpendicular to each other and four (1 R,2R)-cyclohexa-nediamine units lie on every corner of the cage (Fig. 2b and c).",topology
"However, no single crystals of NC3-Rsuitable for X-ray crystal-lographic analysis could be obtained. The structure of NC3-Rwas confirmed by the presence of a clear positive [3 + 6] mole-cular ion peak at m/z= 1407.00 in the ESI-MS spectrum(Fig. S23), as well as in the related FT-IR,1H NMR and13CNMR spectra (see the ESI ?), which indicates that the configur-ation of NC3-Rmay be analogous to the configuration of NC1-S(Fig. 2b).",topology
"NC4- Scrystals were obtained in a yield of 30% by a con-densation reaction between tetraaldehyde 3and (1 R,2R)-cyclo-hexanediamine in the presence of EtOH/H 2O/MOH (M = Na,K, and Cs). X-ray structural analysis (Fig. 2) and the ESI-MSspectrum (Fig. S24 ?)o f NC4- Rreveal that it is a [4 + 8]organic cage in the ＆Z＊geometry, similar to a double [2 + 4]cage. Therefore, it can be concluded that subtle alterations ofthe tetraaldehyde precursors could result in totally di ?erentcage configurations. To control the formation of these cagestructures, the design of the tetraaldehydes, in particular theangle between the two adjacent phenyl planes, is very impor-tant. The ideal angles for the construction of the [3 + 6] con-figuration may lie in the range of 116 每180∼. However, theresulting cage topologies not only depend on the angles orchemical functionality of the precursors, but also on multipleparameters such as the solvent e ?ect, temperature, and mole-cular interactions in the system. Additionally, no keto 每enoltautomerism is observed in the structures of four iminecages, in which all compounds adopt the same enol form intheir solid states.Synthesis and characterization of COFsWe also successfully extended our strategy to synthesize fourphenol-based COFs including one new COF ( COF-NJU-1 ) andthree reported 汕-ketoenamine-linked COFs ( TpPa-1 ,TpBD andTpTph ),25,34,35as shown in Fig. 3. The synthetic protocol forCOFs was the same as that for POCs described above, exceptthe organic solvent component (Fig. S33 ?). Taking COF-NJU-1as an example, tetraaldehyde 1and KOH (1 : 2, molar ratio)were dissolved in water to form a clear solution, and an N,N∩-diethylformamide (DEF) solution of benzidine (2 equiv. corres-ponding to tetraaldehyde 1) was added under stirring to a ?orda crystalline red-brown precipitate (73% yield) after 24 h (seethe ESI ?for detailed data). It should be noted that ethanolmay not be a suitable choice of solvent in this case becausethe EtOH/H2O/KOH combination did not result in the for-mation of crystalline COF-NJU-1 . We therefore screened severalorganic solvents including acetonitrile, 1,4-dioxane, N,N∩-di-methylformamide (DMF) and DEF for preparing COF-NJU-1and found that DEF/H 2O/KOH was the optimal combination(Fig. 3a).",topology
"Notice: In our experiments,  [4+8] cage NC4-R was isolated  as block  crystals  (Figure S27) in a yield of ~30% via slow evaporation for several weeks, accompanied  by some amorphous by-products with unknown structures  (Figures S17, S20).  Many attempts to avoid yielding the amorphous solid were not successful, including adjusting the solvent ratios, equiv. of NaOH (KOH) and reaction  temperature. Fortunately, NC4-R  could be easily purified  by water or ether  washing and successfully characterized  by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, FT-IR and PXRD.",topology
