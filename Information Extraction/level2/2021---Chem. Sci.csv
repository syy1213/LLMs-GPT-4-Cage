"The porosity of cages was estimated using carbon dioxide(CO 2) sorption at 196 K, as they exhibit less signi 祈cant N 2sorption behavior at 77 K (Fig. S44 每S49?), which is o 徇enobserved in porous molecular organic crystals such ashydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs),79,80supramolec-ular organic frameworks (SOFs),81,82and POCs.83,84As displayedin Fig. 5 and Table S3, ?CO 2adsorption isotherms suggest thatthese hydrazone-linked POCs can adsorb a moderately highvolume of CO2with capacities up to 234 cm3g/C01at 196 K and760 mmHg. This value is comparable to those of other reportedPOC materials (PB-2, 265 cm3g/C01; Fe-PB, 225 cm3g/C01).45,85Thecalculated Brunauer 每Emmett 每Teller (BET) surface areas ofcages are within the range of 373 to 563 m2g/C01(Table S3 ?andFig. S50 每S55?). Notably, these calculated surface areas do notmatch their cavity volumes, possibly due to the absence ofproper connectivity between cavity voids, and/or due to cavityvoids in the solid crystal packing being blocked by neighboringcages a 徇er desolvation (Fig. S38 每S43?). Moreover, CO2andacetylene (C 2H2) adsorptions of HPOC-101 toHPOC-104 atroom temperature were also explored, a ?ording C 2H2capacityfrom 31 to 47 cm3g/C01and CO 2capacity from 24 to 33 cm3g/C01(Fig. 4c and S57 每S59?). As they all prefer to adsorb C 2H2overCO2, dynamic C 2H2/CO 2(50% : 50%) breakthrough experi-ments for HPOC-102 and HPOC-104 were performed (Fig. 4dand S60 ?).

"Water-stable hydrazone-linked porous organic cagesA convenient method for constructing water-stable hydrazone-linked porous organic cages with tunable structures from [2+4] lantern, [3+6] triangular prism, unprecedented [4+8] square prism, to extra-large [6+12] octahedron has been reported. They are fully determined by single-crystal X-ray crystallography and exhibit tunable window diameters and cavity volumes from 5.4 to 11.1 nm and 580 to 6800 ?3, respectively. Moreover, they can be used as robust absorbents for eff  ective removal of various pollutants from water, including radionuclide waste, toxic heavy metal ions, and organic micropollutants.",topology
"66每70In this work, seven new water-robust POCs with speci 祈c crystal structures, including the [2 + 4]lantern, [3 + 6] triangular prism, unprecedented [4 + 8] squareprism, and gigantic [6 + 12] octahedron, are constructed fromthe same concave-shaped tetraformyl-functionalized C4RA(C4RACHO) sca ?old and di ?erent dihydrazide linkers with onlyN,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as solvent (Scheme 1). Althoughit has remained challenging to develop a general syntheticmethod for systematic preparation of versatile POC crystals, thiswork suggests that C4RACHO can be a good candidate to reachthis goal. Moreover, their application in removing watercontaminants has been explored.",topology
"Initially, using propanedioyl dihydrazide isolated a [2 + 4]lantern-shaped organic cage, namely HPOC-101 , constructedfrom two C4RACHO as vertexes and four propanedioyl dihy-drazide linkers as pillars (Fig. 1 and S1 ?). SCXRD analysissuggests that HPOC-101 crystallizes in a triclinic system witha space group of P-1, exhibiting two cage molecules per unit celland eight DMF solvent molecules. These DMF molecules are alllocated in the cage interstices (Fig. S2 ?).HPOC-101 consists ofone central lantern-shaped cavity and four rhombus-shapedwindows, which remarkably resemble our previously reportedamine-linked organic cage constructed from propane-1,3-diamine. Its cavity height is about 1.34 nm (measured betweenScheme 1 Self-assembly of organic cages constructed from the tet-ratopic C4RACHO cavitand and dihydrazide linkers.",topology

Carbon isgrey, oxygen is red, and nitrogen is blue. The hydrogen atoms and iso-butyl groups are omitted for clarity.",topology
"Notably, these four oexible alkanedihydrazide linkers have notbeen previously employed in constructing organic cages.SCXRD measurements reveal that they exhibit the same [2 + 4]assembly modes as HPOC-101 . Except for HPOC-104 , whichcrystallizes in the monoclinic C2/cspace group, the remainingHPOC-102 andHPOC-103 both crystallize in the triclinic spacegroup P-1, the same as HPOC-101 . In the extended structures ofHPOC-102 toHPOC-104 , their cage cavities and/or intersticesare祈lled with DMF solvent molecules (Fig. S3 每S5?). Furtherinspection of their crystal structures demonstrated that oxygenatoms of alkanedihydrazides from HPOC-101 toHPOC-103 areon the same side, while those in HPOC-104 are on the oppositeside. Such di ?erence leads to two calix[4]resorcinarene units inHPOC-104 with a gauche conformation, while the other threecages adopt eclipsed conformations (Fig. S9 ?). Accordingly,HPOC-101 toHPOC-103 can be regarded as regular lanterns,whereas HPOC-104 is a distorted lantern. By increasing thepillar length, the inner cavity height and cavity volumes fromHPOC-101 toHPOC-103 gradually increased from 1.34 to 1.61nm and 582 to 833 ?A3(Table S3 ?), respectively. Given thedistortion, the cavity height and volume of HPOC-104 are 1.59nm and 859 ?A3, which are close to those of HPOC-103 . More-over, the related window diameters for HPOC-102 ,HPOC-103 ,andHPOC-104 are 5.60, 6.32, and 6.60 ?A, respectively.",topology
"Following that, using V-shaped m-phthaloyldihydrazide andC4RACHO unexpectedly a ?orded a mixture of block-shaped(HPOC-201 ) and rhombus-shaped ( HPOC-301 ) crystal mixtureswith a ratio of about 1 : 7 (Fig. S1 ?). Such a phenomenon hasalso been observed in other supramolecular macrocycles,metal 每organic nanocages, and organic cage systems.74每77Allattempts to control the assembly of these two cages by varyingsolvent and/or temperature were unsuccessful. SCXRD analysisindicates that the block-shaped crystal is a common [3 + 6]triangular prism assembled from three C4RACHO cavitands asfaces and six m-phthaloyldihydrazide ligands as edges. On theother hand, the rhombus-shaped crystal possesses an unprec-edented [4 + 8] square prism with four C4RACHO faces andeight m-phthaloyldihydrazide edges (Fig. 2). Both structures aresigni祈cantly di ?erent from previously reported dimeric cagesbased on m-phthaloyldihydrazide, but methylene-bridged tet-raformylresorcin[4]arene cavitands, demonstrating a slightchange in the cavitand parent that largely in ouences theresulting cage shapes.",topology
"57Moreover, the self-assembly of rigid 1,3-phenylenediamine and C4RACHO only a ?ords the [3 + 6]triangular prism in our previous report,67indicating thatincreasing linker oexibility (in this case m-phthaloyldihydrazidecompared to m-phenylenediamine) can be an e ?ective way toincrease organic cage structural diversity. SCXRD analysisreveals that both HPOC-201 and HPOC-301 are in the mono-clinic space group C2/cwith a large cavity and two windows.",topology
"Close inspection of the structures revealed that all windows inHPOC-201 are similar, but di ?erent in HPOC-301 .

The four phenyl rings on one side of HPOC-Fig. 2 Schematic illustration of the assembly of the [3 + 6] triangular prism and [4 + 8] square prism based on C4RACHO and the V-shaped m-phthaloyldihydrazide linker and their X-ray crystal structures. The hydrogen atoms and iso-butyl groups are omitted for clarity.",topology
"Finally, a gigantic octahedral [6 + 12] organic cage ( HPOC-401) was obtained from the self-assembly of linear tereph-thalohydrazide and C4RACHO units (Fig. 3). SCXRD analysisreveals that HPOC-401 exhibits a large asymmetric unit andbelongs to the orthogonal space group Pnnn with six cagemolecules per unit cell. Due to weak crystal di ?raction, DMFsolvent molecules in the cage cavity and interstice were alsochallenging to determine. Its molecular shape is similar to thatof the reported organic cage constructed from the C4RACHOsca?old and p-phenylenediamine linkers. HPOC-401 featuresan extra-large octahedral cavity and eight trigonal windows. Itscalculated maximum cavity diameter (measured betweenbottom centers of opposite C4RA units) and volume are about3.25 nm and 6800 ?A3, which are the largest in reported hydra-zone-linked organic cages characterized by SCXRD. To date, thelargest reported hydrazone-linked organic cage is a [3 + 3] RC4A-based cage constructed from three tetraformyl-functionalizedRC4As and three tetrahydrazone-functionalized RC4As, con-taining an internal cavity with a maximum diameter of 2.12 nmand volume of about 1883 ?A3calculated by Voidoo.56Moreover,the average length of the trigonal window is about 2.0 nm(measured between the neighboring bridge carbon of C4RAunits), which is large enough to accommodate a molecule witha diameter of 9.51 nm.",topology
"The crystal data, window diameters, and cavity volumes forthe abovementioned hydrazone-linked POCs are summarized inTable S3. ?Apart from SCXRD data, the aforementioned hydra-zone-linked C4RA-based POC samples were further character-ized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), mass-spectrometry (MS), and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1HNMR) analytical measurements. FT-IR spectra of all POCsexhibit a characteristic C ]N stretching around 1666 cm/C01(Fig. S12 每S18?).1H NMR spectra do not show any characteristicpeak of 每CHO of C4RACHO; instead, they show peaks charac-teristic of H 每C]N at about 8.6 ppm for [2 + 4] hydrazone-linkedPOCs and about 9.0 ppm for the remaining POCs (Fig. S19 每S24?). Moreover, the observed m/zvalues of molecular ion peaksfor each POC were consistent with their calculated molarmasses (Fig. S25 每S31?), demonstrating the presence of intacthydrazone-linked cages in solutions. Thermogravimetric anal-ysis (TGA) reveals that POCs are thermally stable up to /C24280/C14Cunder nitrogen (N 2) gas (Fig. S32 每S37?). In addition, their waterstability was con 祈rmed by measuring1H NMR spectra of POCsamples being soaked in water for a week, and the unchangedsignals indicate the robustness of cages in water (Fig. 4 insetand Fig. S20 每S24?). Notably, these hydrazone-linked cagearchitectures remain intact following guest solvent removalbecause the above-mentioned FT-IR, MS, and1H NMR charac-terization studies are conducted on desolvated samples.",topology
"ConclusionsIn summary, we have developed a general synthetic methodusing DMF as a solvent for constructing versatile hydrazone-linked POCs using the same tetraformylresorcin[4]arene cav-itand and three di ?erent types of dihydrazide ligands, includingoexible alkanedihydrazide, V-shaped m-phthaloyldihydrazide,and linear terephthalohydrazide based on the hydrazonecoupling reaction.

Their windowdiameters and cavity volumes can be precisely tuned from 5.4 to11.1 ?A and 580 to 6800 ?A3using speci 祈c dihydrazide linkers. Tothe best of our knowledge, the square prism shape of HPOC-301has not been observed in organic cage systems, whereas HPOC-401is the largest hydrazone-linked organic cage with a uniqueX-ray crystal structure. Moreover, the abovementioned sevenPOCs greatly increase the number of hydrazone-linked organiccages with determined crystal structures, as only four of themwere previously solved by SCXRD. Moreover, this study mayshed light on solving the di ?culty in hydrazone-linked COFcrystal growth and structure determination. Interestingly, thesehydrazone-linked POCs are stable in water and can e ?ectivelyremove various types of water pollutants from radionuclidewaste, toxic heavy metal ions, and organic micropollutants. Tothe best of our knowledge, HPOC-101 and HPOC-401 are the祈rst two examples of POC adsorbents for systematic removal ofmany kinds of these pollutants. This 祈nding not only revealsthat CR4ACHO can be regarded as an excellent molecularbuilding block to construct versatile robust POCs but alsobroadens the application of POC materials in aqueous systems.Research on rational construction of robust calix[4]Fig. 5 (a) Time-dependent adsorption of aqueous I 3/C0by hydrazone-linked POCs, inset: the recyclability of HPOC-101 for I 3/C0removal.

"28Section S4e. PXRDs of HPOCs:PXRD analysis showed that all the experimental  powder X-ray diffractograms of HPOC  samples do not keep their original  crystallinity compared to the powder X-ray diffractograms calculated  from their single crystal structure data. However,  [2+4] HPOCs still kept crystallinity after being taken from mother liquor as well as after adsorption, while  the rest larger ones quickly become amorphous. This might be ascribed  to that the packing of the isolated cage compounds are assembled by weak supramolecular  interactions, which are different  to MOFs and COFs assembled  with much  stronger coordination bonds and covalent bonds, respectively. These phenomena  are often observed in cage system, especially  for those with large cavities.S9-S11Fig. S38. PXRD  patterns  of HPOC-101 .",topology
