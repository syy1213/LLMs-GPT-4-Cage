"Intrigued by these observations, we next investigated thepossible kinetic competition between the formation of COP-Vand COP-VI . It should be noted that the pendant arms (carba-zole or benzene) attached to the central panels (porphyrin orbenzene) can freely rotate in all the monomers tested and arenot preorganized to form a particular product. Since monomersare multitopic and self-reacting, the initial formation of thedimeric intermediate [1+1]Ilikely triggers intramolecular cycli-zation to form macrocyclic intermediates [1+1]IIand further toform cages (Fig. 2). We indeed observed the formation ofa signi 祈cant amount of macrocyclic dimers [1+1]IIin the earlystage of dynamic assembly of COP-V , experimentally supportingthe above pathway.54By contrast, the formation of tetrahedron-shaped COP-VI , in which each monomer unit has to connectwith three other monomers, involves at least one moreScheme 4 (a) General alkylidyne mechanism of alkyne metathesis; (b)head-to-tail or head-to-head arrangement of alkylidynes leading tononproductive or productive pathway in the cage synthesis.",topology
"View Article Onlineintermolecular reaction and three intramolecular cyclizationsteps from the dimeric intermediate [1+1]I. Therefore, theformation of dimeric cages ( e.g.COP-I ,COP-VII ), interlockeddimer complexes ( COP-II ) or a tetramer COP-IV orCOP-V arekinetically preferred. Unless there is a strong thermodynamicdriving force towards COP-VI , its formation could thus belimited. When a benzene ring is used as the planar central piecein a monomer, the pendant third arms on the macrocyclicintermediate [1+1]IIprefer intermolecular cyclization to forma tetramer COP-IV orCOP-V rather than forming a dimer cage,presumably due to the signi 祈cant angle strain built up in thelatter case as discussed previously. The assemblies of buildingblocks vary signi 祈cantly with the choice of connecting chemicalbonds that display di ?erent properties, such as kinetics,directional/non-directional, bond angles, and torsional/rota-tional freedoms. The dynamic assembly of COPs through alkynemetathesis, which is self-reacting, represents a complex systemin which both thermodynamic and kinetic factors have to beconsidered.ConclusionsThe design and syntheses of aryleneethynylene COPs throughdynamic alkyne metathesis cyclooligomeriztion approach andthe e?ect of the size and geometry of the building units on the祈nal outcome of assembly process were systematically investi-gated. Alkyne metathesis is a non-directional exchange reac-tion, which requires regioselective arrangement of ethynylenegroups in order to proceed the productive pathway. As a result,the dynamic assembly through alkyne metathesis is signi 祈-cantly in 祇uenced by the geometrical properties of buildingblocks. Our study indicates the size of building blocks playsa signi 祈cant role in determining the topology of the assemblystructure. Depending on the size of top and bottom panels,dimeric cage, tetrameric cage, or interlocked dimeric cage wereobtained from the monomers with the same face-to-edge angle.",topology
"View Article Onlinecyclization. The initial bimolecular reaction to form [1+1]Idimer, followed by a series of subsequent intramolecularcyclizations rather than intermolecular reactions, would bepreferred. Therefore, the formation of tetrahedron-shapedCOPs ( e.g. COP-VI ), which involves more intermolecularmetathesis steps, is kinetically disfavored. However, formationof such a cage structure can be predominant when there isa strong thermodynamic preference. The dynamic assemblythrough non-directional alkyne metathesis is complicated, inwhich both thermodynamic stability and kinetic factors couldplay critical roles in determining the 祈nal product. Althougha general predictable relationship between building blocks andthe assembled structures can be deduced by exploiting analogybetween supramolecular and covalent assembly, accurateassessment of such a relationship still remains challengingconsidering the diversity of dynamic reactions and thecomplexity of dynamic assembly process. We carefully designbuilding blocks based on literature precedents and experience,however, all too o 徇en our planning instead brings somethingsurprising, yet logical. Our study will shed some light on thisintriguing dynamic covalent assembly, which has showntremendous potential in chemistry, material science andbiology.",topology
