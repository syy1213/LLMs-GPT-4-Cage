X-ray single crystal diffraction data  for the Phos-cage  in DCM/EtOH mixture  was collected on a Bruker Apex diffractometer and 1.5 kW graphite monochromated Mo radiatio n (Öñ = 0.71073 ?) using 0.3 ¡«Àß scan steps spanning at least a hemisphere of reciprocal space for all structures. The frames were integrated with the SAINT v6.45a (Bruker, 2005). A semi -empirical absorption correction using multiple -reflections was carried out using the program SADABS V2008 -1.5X.  The excitation and emission spectra were recorded with a HORIBA Scientific made Fluoromax -4 spectrometer  for samples in solution and at aggregate.
