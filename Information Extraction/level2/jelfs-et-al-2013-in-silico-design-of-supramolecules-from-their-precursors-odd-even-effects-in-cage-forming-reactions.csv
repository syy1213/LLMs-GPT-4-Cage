To a cooled (0 ¡ãC) solution of propane-1,3-diamine (54.4 mg, 1.58 eq) and DMF (1 drop as internal NMR standard) in DCM (50 mL) was added by syringe pump a solution of benzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde (75.2 mg, 1.0 eq) in DCM (40 mL) over 24 h. The resultant mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and maintained for 72 h to afford a turbid solution. Completion of the reaction was confirmed by 1H NMR. Mass spectrometry (MS) and NMR data were obtained directly by in situ sampling of the reaction mixtures. All attempts at isolating the product resulted in significant amounts of insoluble materials being formed. Yields were therefore calculated by use of an internal standard (DMF), which was added to the solution of the aldehyde in DCM prior to addition of the amine. Integrals associated with the aldehyde (-CH=O, 10.22 ppm), before addition, and the imine  (-CH=N, 8.14 and 8.22 ppm for CC-propane and CC-butane respectively), at reaction completion, were normalized against the standard to determine the proportion of cage in solution once the reaction was complete. Insoluble material was assumed not to be product. The in situ NMR showed clean, single product with the expected [2+3] stoichiometry, with integration relative to DMF demonstrating a yield of 24 %. The remainder of the product was an insoluble polymer. m/z = 439.3 (M+H+); 1H NMR: (400 MHz, CDCl3) ¦Ä ppm 2.41 (quin, J = 5.0 Hz, 2 H) 3.89 (t, J = 5.0 Hz, 4 H) 7.79 (s, 3 H) 8.14 (s, 3 H).",comprehensive synthesis
" ?S3	 ?Attempts at purifying the material by filtration resulted in the material becoming insoluble on isolation. Concentrating the material and then slowly evaporating the solvent also resulted in insoluble material being formed.   We also attempted to adjust the solvent environment post-synthesis: To a colorless, cooled (0 ¡ãC) solution of 1,3,5-triformylbenzene (450 mg) in dichloromethane (100 mL) was added, under nitrogen, a solution of 1,3-propanediamine (309 mg) in dichloromethane (130 mL) over 18 h to afford a colorless solution. The resultant mixture was maintained for 120 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure (1/2 volume) and diluted with methanol, this procedure being repeated three times to afford a clear, colorless solution in which was suspended an off-white solid. This material was found to be insoluble in chloroform after isolation by filtration.  Finally, we attempted to isolate the material by slow crystallisation. Here, samples (prepared by taking the solutions of DMF-internal-standard experiments) were dissolved in DCM, filtered, and placed in 3 dram vials. These were placed into 10 dram vials, to which was subsequently added MeOH, EtOAc, CHCl3, IPA, Et2O, iPr2O, EtOH, acetone, THF, hexane, MeCN or Toluene: The table below shows the results of these attempts at isolation.

The resultant mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and maintained for 72 h to afford a turbid solution. Completion of the reaction was confirmed by 1H NMR. Again, MS and NMR data were obtained directly from reaction mixtures. The in situ NMR showed a clean, single product with the expected [2+3] stoichiometry, with integration relative to DMF demonstrating a yield of 27 % (using the imine peak at 8.23 ppm). The remainder of the product was insoluble.

The resultant mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and maintained for 120 h to afford a clear, light-yellow solution. Solvents were removed under reduced pressure to afford a pale yellow solid (875 mg, 100 %).

"*SSupporting InformationABSTRACT: We synthesize a series of imine cagemolecules where increasing the chain length of thealkanediamine precursor results in an odd ?even alter-nation between [2 + 3] and [4 + 6] cage macrocycles. Acomputational procedure is developed to predict thethermodynamically preferred product and the lowestenergy conformer, hence rationalizing the observedalternation and the 3D cage structures, based onknowledge of the precursors alone.",topology
"Previously, we and others have synthesized a range of porousimine cages by the condensation reaction of trialdehydes anddiamines in n[2 + 3] reactions to form [2 + 3],24,25[4 + 6],8,17and [8 + 12]26cages. The variation in cage size is a typicalexample of ¡®emergent behavior ¡¯, since the trends observed arenot simply intuitive. For instance, a small change in the diaminestructure from 1,2-cyclopentane diamine to 1,2-cyclohexanediamine directs the product from a highly porous [4 + 6] cage17to a nonporous and much larger [8 + 12] cage.26We have notyet observed any clear dependence on the choice of reactionsolvent, but Warmuth et al. demonstrated variation betweenthree di ?erent imine cage sizes that depend on solvent choiceas well as ligand geometry.",topology
"23Here, we synthesize a series of imine cages with increasingalkanediamine chain length (see reaction scheme, Figure 1),and examine the e ?ect on the cage size. We then usecomputational methods to rationalize the observed trend andshow that it is possible to predict the size and 3D structure ofthese cages accurately. Previously, the [4 + 6] cage, CC1, wasprepared via the condensation reaction of 1,3,5-triformylben-zene with 1,2-ethanediamine.",topology
"To examine the relative energies of the potential n[2 + 3]combinations and the associated conformers of these cages,models for each precursor combination were built in both a [2+ 3] and [4 + 6] ratio, assuming initially a similar geometry tothat observed in earlier cages synthesized by our group. TheOPLS all-atom force ?eld28was used, since this wasparametrized for organic systems with a focus on conformerenergetics, intermolecular energies, and thermodynamic prop-erties. OPLS was found to perform well at reproducingpreviously reported imine cage structures and energetics (seeSI, Section 2.2 and Figure S6 for validation and testing of thismethodology). Next, we used the MacroModel conformersearching tool to search for all the low-energy conformers ofeach structure, using the low-mode sampling method,29followed by re ?nement of the lowest energy conformationsusing dispersion-corrected DFT. The conformer generationand re ?nement were coupled with an automated procedure tocheck for conformations with an internal ¡®pore ¡¯,d e?ned here asa spherical void with a radius of >2.5 ?.",topology
"Our synthetic experiments showed a clear alternation in thecage size with increasing alkanediamine chain length. Diamineswith an even number of carbon atoms all formed a [4 + 6] cage,while those with an odd number formed a [2 + 3] cage, ascon?rmed in each case by mass spectrometry (SI Section 1 andTable 1 for the molecular ion masses). Single crystal X-raydi?raction structures for the [4 + 6] cage CC18and, here, forthe new CC-pentane cage, are also consistent with this odd/even alternation rule.30Odd?even e ?ects are well-known for n-alkanes and theirderivatives,31with alternating patterns observed in properties,such as melting point.32An odd ?even e ?ect arising from thechain conformation is also observed for n-alkane assembly intomonolayers on surfaces33and in the formation of di ?erentnetwork topologies,34but to our knowledge this is the ?rstexample of this e ?ect in macrocyclic organic cage compounds.",topology
"The [2 + 3]/[4 + 6] cage alternation rule was observed forall cages in this series across a range of reaction solvents,including dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, methanol, andethanol. This insensitivity to solvent suggests that thealternating preference for [2 + 3] and [4 + 6] cage structuresis intrinsic and outweighs any in ?uence of solvent stabilizationenergies. With the exception of CC1, which can be eitherporous or nonporous depending on its solid-state polymorph,35no permanent porosity was observed in any other the othersolid materials isolated here.",topology
"These initial screening calculations were designed to identifythe most likely reaction product formed in solution, rather thanthe solid-state structure. Therefore, we only compared theenergies of [4 + 6] conformations that possess an internalcavity, ignoring those that are ¡°collapsed ¡±and that hence lack apore. We chose this approach because the cages are formedinitially in solution with solvent molecules inside the cages thatcan act as sca ?olds. For example, in a previous study for a cagemolecule that collapses, we observed a cage cavity in the solvatestructure which was lost upon desolvation:26indeed, thatmaterial contained so much solvent that it was akin to a¡®solution-phase ¡¯single crystal structure. Here, we de ?ned a¡®pore ¡¯as being present if the spherical radius of the cavity waslarger than 2.5 ?, which is su ?cient to encapsulate any of thesolvents used here (SI, Section 2.5). If collapsed conformationsFigure 1.

"The lowest energy combination calculated for each moleculewas found to be [4 + 6] for CC1 (?61 kJ mol?1) and CC-butane (?37 kJ mol?1), and [2 + 3] for CC-propane (?21 kJmol?1) and CC-pentane (?48 kJ mol?1) (Figure 1). Theenergies given in parentheses here are expressed as relativeenergy per [2 + 3] unit with respect to the alternative cage size.Hence, these calculations match the experimental observationof an odd ?even e ?ect. Table S3 gives the relative energies forall the low-energy conformers, and Figure S9 gives thestructures for the lowest energy conformer for eachstoichiometry. The energetically preferred ¡®in?ated ¡¯structuresare all shown in Figure 1. For CC1, only one low-energyconformer (de ?ned as lying within 20 kJ mol?1of the minimumenergy conformer and ignoring mirror images) was found forthe hypothetical [2 + 3] combination. However, twoconformers, one with Tand one with C3symmetry, werefound for the [4 + 6] case. Both of these conformers werepreviously observed in a dichloromethane solvate of CC1, butonly the lowest energy Tconformer was seen in the desolvatedCC1 solid (Figure 2).35For the longer chain diamines, therewere often several low-energy conformers, typically di ?eringonly by small torsional di ?erences in the alkane chains. Forboth of the [2 + 3] cages, the imine groups of the two aryl facesare aligned in the lowest energy [2 + 3] conformation, such thatthey have a C3axis running through the centers of the arenerings.",topology
"As for the origin of this odd/even alternation, the [2 + 3]CC1 cage is energetically disfavored because the ethane linkeris simply too short to separate the aryl cage faces withoutunfavorable distortion of the arenes. For cages with longeralkane chains, it appears that the self-assembly is directedtoward structures that allow a staggered anti conformation inthe alkane chain, resulting in the nitrogen atoms beingstaggered gauche with respect to each other in the [4 + 6]molecules or in an eclipsed con ?guration in the [2 + 3]molecules (Table 1).",topology
"An examination of the conformations allows us to commenton the molecules ¡¯shape persistence. All of the [4 + 6]molecules, with the exception of CC1, have low-lying collapsedconformations, possibly because of the easy rotation aboutalkane chain conformations (Figure S9). This explains theexperimental observation that the other [4 + 6] cage, CC-butane , is non-porous and is not stable to desolvation. Thecomparison of computed energies for ¡®porous ¡¯,i n?atedconformers and alternative non-porous, ¡®collapsed ¡¯conformersgives us a methodology to screen in silico for new intrinsicallyporous cages. Indeed, one could predict from these calculations,a priori , that CC1 is a good candidate for intrinsic porosity,while CC-butane is not.",topology

"(30) Preliminary data suggest that this odd ?even trend extendsfurther to larger diamines. 1,6-Hexane-diamine yields a complexreaction mixture that is hard to characterize, although massspectrometry shows clearly the presence of the [4 + 6] cage.

The solvent was removed using PLATON/SQUEEZE and is not shown.

(equivalent to the radius of a nitrogen molecule7) in Materials Studio 5.0 (Accelrys Inc.). Carbons are shown in grey, nitrogens in blue, and hydrogens in white.  2. Computational details  2.1. Conformer searching method We used the MacroModel (version 9.9, Schr?dinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2011) conformer searching tool to search for all the low-energy conformers for each structure.	 ?We first validated that this approach finds known alternative conformers for published organic cage systems, and that it gives reasonable relative energies by examining case studies from other imine cages that we have reported previously (see Section 2.4). The procedure uses a low-mode (LMOD)8 sampling approach which follows the low frequency eigenvectors of the molecule. This has been used previously to examine cyclic alkanes. We used 50,000 search steps for [2+3] molecules and 500,000 steps for the larger [4+6] molecules. The maximum and minimum move distances were 3 and 12 ?, with all structures within an energy window of 50 kJ mol-1 of the lowest energy structure being retained. This number of steps was chosen because repeats of the calculations found no new low energy structures, with each conformation sampled multiple times within an individual run. For geometry optimization, the convergence criterion was a remaining RMS force of 0.05 kJ mol-1 ?-1. These cages can often exist in two alternative enantiomers (R and S) related by helical chirality:9 since these have equivalent energies, we only retained one mirror-image conformer. We used an automated procedure (Section 2.5) to check for conformations with an internal ¡®pore¡¯, defined here as a spherical space with a radius of >2.5 ?. If none was found, then we repeated the search with an additional 250,000 steps and a search window of 500 kJ mol-1 in order to see whether any structures with an internal void could be found lying higher in energy.  We applied a final refinement of the structures and energies by optimizing the resulting molecular structures with DFT-D3 calculations performed in CP2K10 with the PBE functional,11 TZVP-MOLOPT basis sets,12 GTH-type pseudopotential,13 a plane wave grid cutoff of 400 Ry, a cubic box of length 50 ?, and the Grimme-D3 dispersion correction.14 This procedure was applied to any structure within 25 kJ mol-1 of the lowest energy conformer, which we determined as the maximum error in the 	 ?S8	 ?energy difference between structures for the OPLS force field (see Section 2.3). We have previously used this DFT setup to reliably reproduce the structure and energetics of porous imine cages in both the solid state3,15 and as single molecules and dimer pairs.4,16   2.2. Performance of OPLS forcefield for porous organic imine cages Many of the commonly available, transferable forcefields perform poorly at reproducing the structures of porous organic imine cages, either because they do not contain the relevant parameters for, or are poorly parameterized for, the angles and torsions around the imine bond. Hence, optimization of the cage molecules by these forcefields, such as UFF5,17 and PCFF6,18, severely distorts the tetrahedral structure of the cages upon minimization. However, upon testing the OPLS all-atom forcefield (Optimized Potentials for Liquid Simulations),7,19 it performed very well at reproducing both the molecular structures and molecular energies of a range of known imine cages. The OPLS forcefield was developed for organic and biomolecular systems, with the focus on fitting being the energetics of conformers, intermolecular gas phase energies and testing against thermodynamic properties of pure organic liquids, particularly heats of vaporization and densities.  We took single cage molecules from the single crystal X-ray structures of several published imine cages that were also formed using 1,3,5-triformyl benzene: CC2 (1,2-propylenediamine)8,20, CC3 (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)10,20, CC4 (1,2-diaminocyclopentane),11,21 and CC9 (1,2-diphenylethylenediamine)12,22. All of these cages have a [4+6] ratio of aldehyde to amine precursors. We then geometry optimized these isolated cage molecules using OPLS-2005 using Macromodel, part of the Schrodinger software package (MacroModel, version 9.9, Schr?dinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2011), until the remaining force was less than 0.05 kJ ?-1 mol-1. Figure S6 shows overlays of the molecular structure from the X-ray data and the OPLS minimized structures. The structures are very well reproduced, in particular the core cage structures. The root mean square displacements, including hydrogens, are 0.072 ? (CC3), 0.142 ? (CC4) and 0.206 ? (CC9). The CC2 structure cannot be compared in this quantitative fashion due to the disorder in the methyl positions across the two possible vertex positions in the single crystal X-ray diffraction structure. There is some small difference in the cyclopentane vertices of CC4, but these are disordered in the crystal structure in any case. There are also some differences in the phenyl group torsions on the vertices of CC9, where there is presumably facile rotation and a flat potential energy surface. The latter is not considered to be a problem because this type of fragment is not present in the new alkanediamine cage molecules examined here, although this could become an important consideration in building a more generic methodology. Finally, from previous DFT+D calculations on the molecular structures, the two lowest energy CC1 conformers (with T and C3 symmetry, respectively) were found to lie 13 kJ mol-1 apart9,13. Geometry optimized structures of these two molecules in OPLS were found to lie 15 kJ mol-1 apart, a good agreement with this DFT value. Taken in combination, these results gave us confidence that OPLS could be used for the reliable description of both the 3-D structures and the relative energies of the new organic cages reported in the main text.  	 ?S9	 ?

Relative energies of OPLS and DFT In order to select which band of low-energy structures from the OPLS conformer search to refine using PBE/TZVP-MOLOPT DFT+D3 calculations, it was first necessary to establish a confidence level in the forcefield. By determining the maximum magnitude of the energetic reordering of the structures from OPLS to DFT calculations, it can be ensured that the ¡®true¡¯ lowest energy structure is not missed because it lies too far above the lowest energy OPLS structure. To do this, the energies of the [2+3] and [4+6] molecules formed from 1,3,5-triformylbenzene (TFB) and 1,5-diaminopentane were compared from both OPLS and DFT calculations. The results are shown in Figure S6 and Tables S1 and S2. These data show that there is some reordering of the relative energies of the structures, with the absolute numbers being fairly small. For the [2+3] structures, the maximum change in relative energy was found to be 8.2 kJ mol-1, and for the [4+6] structures, the maximum change was 11.4 kJ mol-1. On this basis, the confidence level in the forcefield was determined to be 20 kJ mol-1. Hence, for all systems, all structures from the OPLS conformer search that were within 20 kJ mol-1 of the lowest energy structure were reoptimized in DFT calculations in order to find the final, lowest energy conformer.",topology

Validation of conformer searching approach for porous organic cages To validate the conformer searching procedure, several test case studies were identified, based on porous imine cages that have been reported previously. These test cases were: i) CC1 ¨C there are two alternative T symmetry [4+6] cage molecules (enantiomers labeled R and S have helical chirality); these enantiomers, of course, have the same energy. There is an additional C3 conformer that lies by ~13 kJ mol-1 higher in energy.9,14 ii) CC5 ¨C there are two alternative T symmetry [4+6] cage molecules (R and S enantiomers, again isoenergetic); the lowest energy structure is expected to be !15$!10$!5$0$5$10$15$Rela%ve'energy'(kJ/mol21)'[2+3]'Conf1$in?ated$Conf2$in?ated$Conf3$in?ated$Conf4$in?ated$Conf5$in?ated$!15$!10$!5$0$5$10$15$Rela%ve'energy'(kJ'mol21)'[4+6]'Conf1$in?ated$Conf2$in?ated$Conf3$in?ated$Conf4$in?ated$Conf5$in?ated$	 ?S11	 ?shape-persistent with a cavity, as exemplified by the highly porous nature of the bulk material for this cage.15 iii) CC7 ¨C this is a large [8+12] cage molecule with a shape (in its solvate form) of a rhombicuboctahedral capsule, and a lower energy ¡°collapsed¡± structure that lacks a permanent internal cavity, demonstrating that this cage, unlike CC1 and CC5, is not shape persistent.23  The conformer searching procedure outlined in the main text was carried out on structural models built from the relevant precursors (that is, not taken from single crystal X-ray diffraction data) in order to replicate our approach for the new molecules synthesized in this study, and to reflect the procedure that would be used for a hypothetical molecule that has not yet been synthesized. For these systems, only 15,000 steps were used in the conformer searching procedure. In brief, the results were as follows:  i) For CC1, both of the tetrahedral enantiomers were found with the same energy (to within a fraction of a kJ mol-1). In addition, another conformer was found with C3 symmetry, where some of the Carene-Carene-Cimine-Nimine torsions were flipped by 180¡ã, which lay 13 kJ mol-1 higher in energy than the T conformers as calculated in OPLS. Both conformers were excellent matches with the relevant single crystal X-ray diffraction structures, and no lower-lying ¡®collapsed¡¯ structures were found, validating the known shape-persistence for CC1.  ii) For CC5, the tetrahedral enantiomers were again found as the lowest energy structures, with the next conformer lying 15 kJ mol-1 higher in energy; this had a similar structure, with small rotations of the phenyl groups of the triphenylamine cage face. Again, this molecule was correctly determined to be shape-persistent and no low energy ¡°collapsed¡± structures were found.   iii) For CC7, the lowest energy conformer was found to be a collapsed structure with no internal cavity. More than 100 kJ mol-1 higher in energy (by OPLS) was found the rhombicuboctahedral capsule structure, which was observed in single X-ray crystal diffraction data for the solvated molecule. This is in agreement with the observed lack of shape-persistence for this larger cage, which collapses upon desolvation.  In summary, this conformational searching approach with OPLS successfully reproduces the desired structures, relative energies, and experimental shape-persistence (or lack of) for all three case studies.  2.5 Identifying conformations that contain an internal void: screening for shape-persistence In order to automatically determine whether the various conformations found during the conformer searches for [4+6] molecules contained an internal void, we wrote a PERL script to determine the largest sphere that could fit within the center of the cage. First, the center of mass of each molecule was calculated, and then the shortest distance between this center of mass and any atom of the molecule was determined. This distance, minus the van der Waals radius of the atom (C = 1.7 ?, H = 1.2 ?, and N = 1.55 ?), was then defined as being the radius of the largest sphere that can fit 	 ?S12	 ?within the cage molecule. A molecule was then deemed to have an internal void if this radius was greater than 2.5 ?. This is equivalent to the cage molecule being able to encapsulate small guests such as H2, N2, CO2, Xe, and common organic solvents.   The measured void radius for CC1 here is 2.76 ? (Table S4), and this cage is known to encapsulate solvents such as dichloromethane and ethylacetate24. Hence, since all the ¡°inflated¡± conformations for the other cage molecules studied here have a void larger than this, it seems reasonable to assume that the solvents used here (methanol, DCM, ethyl acetate, ethanol and chloroform) are able to act as scaffolds for any of these structures.",topology

Relative energies of the low energy conformers, expressed per [2+3] unit, from DFT+D3 calculations for [2+3] and [4+6] precursor combinations. The lowest energy conformer for each case is highlighted in bold. The right hand column gives the relative energy for the lowest energy conformer found with no internal cavity, if any.   3.2. Void sizes             Table S4. Radius of the spherical internal void (?) of the lowest energy conformation for each precursor combination. All [4+6] combinations can accommodate solvent, whereas, with the possible exception of the 1,5-pentane system, the [2+3] cages are unlikely to be able to accommodate solvent guests.  3.2.
