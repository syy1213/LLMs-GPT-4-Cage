DOI: 10.31635/ccschem.024.202303625The exploration of ethane (C 2H6)-selective porousmaterials for the direct production of polymer-gradeethylene (C 2H4) from a C 2H6/C2H4mixture in a singleenergy-saving adsorption step is of utmost impor-tance but remains a signi ?cant challenge. Thus, de-veloping robust C 2H6-selective adsorbents with highC2H6capacity and C 2H6/C2H4selectivity is urgentlyneeded for industrial applications. In this study, wehave successfully designed and synthesized two nov-el calix[4]resorcinarene-based porous organic cages(POCs) named CPOC-501 and CPOC-502. The POCswere formed via a Schiff-base reaction involvingface-directed [6+8] condensation between a bowl-shaped tetratopic tetraformylcalix[4]resorcinareneand triangular tritopic amine synthons. Analysisusing single crystal X-ray crystallography revealedthat both cages possess large truncated octahedralcavities with a volume of approximately 6500 ?3and12 accessible rhombic windows with a side length ofapproximately 10.5 ?. Furthermore, the cages exhib-ited excellent chemical stability under neutral, acidic,and basic conditions and high Brunauer ¨CEmmett ¨CTeller speci ?c surface areas of up to 2175 m2g?1afterdesolvation. Both POCs demonstrated superioradsorption capabilities for C 2H6over C 2H4. Notably,CPOC-502 exhibited a C 2H6capacity and C 2H6/C2H4selectivity of 83 cm3g?1and 2.83, respectively,surpassing most of the best-performing C 2H6-selec-tive porous organic materials reported to date.",affiliation

"Results and DiscussionRed block crystals of CPOC-501 and CPOC-502 wereobtained in yields of 71% and 65%, respectively, using a24-fold Schiff base reaction of C4RACHO (1 equiv)with (TAPB, 1.33 equiv) and (TAPT, 1.33 equiv). Subse-quent single crystallographic X-ray determination(SCXRD) revealed that CPOC-501 (CCDC No. 2222407,Figure 1a) crystallized in a triclinic P-1 space group withhalf of a [6+8] organic cage in its asymmetric unit. Incontrast, CPOC-502 (CCDC No. 2222408, Figure 1b)crystallized in a trigonal R-3 space group with one-sixthof the cage ( Supporting Information Table S1 ). The asym-metric units of both cages incorporated residual electrondensity as highly disordered solvent molecules, whichaccounted for approximately 67.8% of the unit cell vol-ume and were subsequently removed by the routineFigure 1 | X-ray single-crystal structures of (a) CPOC-501and (b) CPOC-502 ; solid-state packing of (c) CPOC-501and (d) CPOC-502 viewed from c direction; hydrogenatoms are omitted for clarity.

Notably, this kind of [6+8] octahedral arrange-ment has only been reported in coordination cagesystems71and has not yet been observed in organic cagesin the Cambridge Structural Database.72CPOC-501 andCPOC-502 had a void volume of approximately 6500 ?3,calculated using Voidoo,73,74and an inner diameter ( din)of around 3.3 nm. This places them among the largestpurely organic cages, such as the cubic [8+12] salicyli-mine cage with a dinof 3.3 nm, the [6+12] octahedralCPOC-303 with a dinof 3.9 nm, and the [12+24] porphyrincages with a dinof 4.3 nm.60,75,76There are 12 accessiblerhombic windows with a side length of approximately10.5 ? in both CPOC-501 andCPOC-502 , which are thedistances between the centers of C4RA ¡¯s phenyl ring andthose of TAPB and TAPT. The pore window to the cavityhas a diameter of approximately 7.5 ?, providing suf ?-cient space for gas molecules to enter the cavity. Thesolid-state packing of CPOC-501 suggests that eachsingle cage is closely surrounded by six neighboringcages, forming an ef ?cient packing. The cage cavitiesare connected through the windows, creating open chan-nels along the a,b, and caxes (Figure 1candSupportingInformation Figures S12 and S13 ).

DOI: 10.31635/ccschem.024.202303625Link to VoR: https://doi.org/10.31635/ccschem.024.2023036251IntroductionEthylene (C 2H4), the primary feedstock in the petro-chemical industry, is predominantly produced throughsteam cracking of petroleum-based feedstocks, resultingin ethane (C 2H6) as the major byproduct.1¨C3In industrialsettings, the traditional method for removing C 2H6fromthe C 2H4/C2H6mixture involves large distillation towersoperating under low-temperature and high-pressureconditions.4This process consumes a signi ?cant amountof energy, making exploring alternative and more ef ?-cient C 2H4puri?cation methods imperative. Among thevarious technologies available, adsorption and separa-tion utilizing porous adsorbents have shown promise dueto their low energy consumption. Two types of porousadsorbents are used for C 2H6/C2H4separation: C 2H4-selective and C 2H6-selective porous materials.5¨C7The for-mer relies on introducing open metal sites or highly polargroups into the pores for effective separation,8¨C10whilethe latter involves creating nonpolar/inert-pore surfaceswith aromatic or aliphatic moieties.11¨C13However, C 2H6-selective porous materials often suffer from low capacityand poor selectivity compared to C 2H4-selective materi-als due to their lack of suitable binding sites. Neverthe-less, C 2H6-selective adsorbents offer the advantage ofdirectly providing C 2H4in a single adsorption step, elimi-nating the need for an additional energy-intensivedesorption step. This simpli ?es the separation processand can save nearly 40% of energy consumption.14Thus,there is a strong justi ?cation for developing C 2H6-selective adsorbents with exceptional C 2H6/C2H4sepa-ration performance (high C 2H6capacity and selectivity)and long-lasting durability. Metal ¨Corganic frameworks(MOFs) have been extensively investigated for one-stepC2H6/C2H4separation.15¨C20However, research on purelyporous organic materials (POMs) with a metal-free com-position and native nonpolar/inert pore surfaces, whichare potential candidates as C 2H6-selective adsorbents, isstill in its early stages.21¨C23Porous organic cages (POCs) are an emerging class ofPOMs that are constructed by covalently linking purelyorganic synthons into zero-dimensional (0D) discretemacromolecules with permanent intrinsic cavities.24¨C27With their 0D nature, POCs possess inherent advantagessuch as solution processing, easy regeneration, and pre-cise modi ?cation.28¨C30In 2009, Cooper et al.31publishedthe?rst investigation on tetrahedral [4+4] imine-linked(C=N) POCs for gas sorption, achieving a remarkableBrunauer ¨CEmmett ¨CTeller (BET) surface area of up to624 m2g?1. Since then, the design and synthesis of POCswith different condensation modes, shapes, sizes, andfunctions have seen substantial growth.32¨C43However, thenumber of POCs reported is still much fewer than that ofMOFs and covalent organic framework materials.44¨C49Despite over a decade of continuous efforts, the reportedPOCs mainly exhibit BET values of less than 1000 m2g?1for the limiting cage size, with the exception of cuboc-tahedral [8+12] boronic ester-linked (B ¨CO) POC reportedby Mastalerz and coworkers,50which reached a BET valueexceeding 3000 m2g?1. However, increasing the size oforganic cages often results in porosity loss or reductionduring desolvation, leading to structure collapse and/orimproper packing.51,52In addition, most reported POCsare assembled through dynamic and reversible imine andboronic ester bonds,53¨C55which are susceptible to hydro-lysis under humid conditions, resulting in skeleton col-lapse. These challenges signi ?cantly limit the scope ofPOCs ¡¯research, highlighting the urgent need to explorelarge, robust POCs to expand their applications.",surface area
"The permanent porosity of desolvated CPOC-501 andCPOC-502 was con ?rmed through N 2gas sorptionexperiments conducted at 77 K. As shown in Figure 3,the isotherms of both cages exhibit the typical type Iadsorption behavior. According to the BET model(Supporting Information Figures S16 and S17 ), the sur-face area of CPOC-501 is 1832 m2g?1, while that of CPOC-502 is 2175 m2g?1. Similarly, the Langmuir model(Supporting Information Figures S18 and S19 ) estimatesthe surface areas to be 2221 m2g?1forCPOC-501 and2747 m2g?1forCPOC-502 . These results demonstrate thesubstantial in ?uence of the solid-state packing style onthe cage surface areas, given the closely matched cagevolumes of both CPOCs. The pore-size distribution (PSD)was determined using the density functional theory mod-el. According to Zeo++ software,80the PSD values forCPOC-501 (¡«1.85 nm) and CPOC-502 (¡«1.94 nm) corre-late with the calculated largest pore diameters of 1.94and 1.99 nm, respectively.",surface area
"These dimensions render them among the largest POCsreported to date. Importantly, their crystal structuresrepresent the ?rst examples of [6+8] POCs determinedby X-ray diffraction. The exceptional chemical stabilityexhibited by these cages in various aqueous, acidic, andbasic conditions can be attributed to the multivalencesresulting from multiple amine bonds via keto-enaminetautomerization. Notably, CPOC-501 andCPOC-502 dis-play an impressive surface area of up to 2175 m2g?1andexhibit a pronounced preference for adsorbing C 2H6overC2H4. The C 2H6/C2H4selectivities observed in thesecages reach remarkable values of up to 2.83, which pre-sents one of the highest in reported POMs. Moreover, wehave conducted breakthrough experiments to validatethe practical performance of these POCs. The resultsdemonstrate the capability of CPOC-501 and CPOC-502 to effectively separate C 2H4from C 2H6/C2H4gasmixtures in a single adsorption step, yielding high-purityC2H4(>99.9%). Furthermore, these POCs exhibit excel-lent recyclability, maintaining their separation ef ?ciencyfor up to six cycles without deterioration. Moreover, theCPOCs can be prepared easily under mild reaction con-ditions and separated easily in considerably high yields.",surface area

However, another directional-bonding ap-proach, face-directed [6+8] condensation employingtetratopic and tritopic synthons (Scheme 1b), can alsobe employed to construct octahedral cages.68,69Withthis in mind, we employed 1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl)ben-zene (TAPB) and 2,4,6-tris(4-aminophenyl)-1,3,5-triazine(TAPT) tritopic synthons in combination with C4RACHOto synthesize face-directed [6+8] octahedral POCs,namely CPOC-501 and CPOC-502 (Scheme 1c). BothPOCs possess a large truncated octahedral cavity with12 guest-accessible windows and exhibit excellent stabil-ity under acidic and basic conditions and high porosityafter desolvation. Intriguingly, both cages preferredadsorbing C 2H6over C 2H4, as con ?rmed by break-through experiments.
