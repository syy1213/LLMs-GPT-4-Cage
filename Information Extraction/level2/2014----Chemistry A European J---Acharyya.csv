"The dynamic covalent bond, namely the imine bond, allowsthe removal of errors during formation, which leads to a ther-modynamically most stable combination in the majority ofcases.[8a]Does this dynamic nature of the imine bond allowself-sorting in 3D organic cage formation? Indeed it does. Inour recent publication,[14]we were successfully able to showhow the dynamic nature of the imine bond maneuvered theefficient formation of 3D self-sorted architectures. Additionally,we also showed an example of a cage-to-cage transformation,depending on the preference for a partner over another ina complex reaction mixture. Therein, our main focus was tolook into the self-sorting behavior of two randomly selected al-dehydes, irrespective of their geometrical background. Afterhaving such unusual self-sorting behavior in the formation ofpurely covalent cages from randomly chosen components, thequestion that we asked is whether chemists can direct/controlsuch self-sorting. If so, what strategy can help chemists to con-trol the outcome?It is a well-accepted fact that most of the self-sorting sys-tems operate on the basis of difference in geometric shapes/[a]K.

"&Cage CompoundsHydrogen-Bond-Driven Controlled Molecular Marriage in CovalentCagesKoushik Acharyya and Partha Sarathi Mukherjee*[a]Abstract: A supramolecular approach that uses hydrogen-bonding interaction as a driving force to accomplish excep-tional self-sorting in the formation of imine-based covalentorganic cages is discussed. Utilizing the dynamic covalentchemistry approach from three geometrically similar dialde-hydes ( A,B, and D) and the flexible triamine tris(2-amino-ethyl)amine ( X), three new [3 +2] self-assembled nanoscopicorganic cages have been synthesized and fully characterizedby various techniques. When a complex mixture of the di-aldehydes and triamine Xwas subjected to reaction, it wasfound that only dialdehyde B(which has OH groups for H-bonding) reacted to form the corresponding cage B3X2se-lectively. Surprisingly, the same reaction in the absence of al-dehyde Byielded a mixture of products. Theoretical and ex-perimental investigations are in complete agreement thatthe presence of the hydroxyl moiety adjacent to the alde-hyde functionality in Bis responsible for the selective forma-tion of cage B3X2from a complex reaction mixture. Thisspectacular selection was further analyzed by transforminga nonpreferred (non-hydroxy) cage into a preferred (hy-droxy) cage B3X2by treating the former with aldehyde B.",this paper's author

"Results and DiscussionDialdehydes A,B,C, and Dwere selected for the present study(Scheme 1). Among them, Bis furnished with a hydroxylmoiety adjacent to the aldehyde functionality. It is well docu-mented in the literature that a hydroxyl group adjacent ( orthoposition) to an aldehyde/imine functionality is capable of form-ing a stable six-membered ring through HOH¡¤¡¤¡¤OCHO/HOH¡¤¡¤¡¤NCHNin-tramolecular hydrogen bonding.[16, 17]We envisioned that suchsupramolecular interaction can manipulate the fate of a reac-tion in which competing components are present. Before per-forming competitive experiments, all of the dialdehydes wereallowed to react separately with the triamine tris(2-amino-ethyl)amine ( X) in chloroform at room temperature underdilute conditions. The purity and formation of all the newlysynthesized compounds were fully verified on the basis of1Hand13CN M R ,1H¨C1H COSY , HMQC, FTIR, ESI-HRMS, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. These experimental resultsunambiguously affirmed the formation of [3 +2] imine-basedcages except in the case of C, for which we encountered theformation of insoluble oligomeric or polymeric material. Thiscould be attributed to the steric bulk arising due to the pres-ence of a methoxy group adjacent to the aldehyde functionali-ty, which restricts it to preorganize during the reaction andthus leads to the formation of undesired oligomeric or poly-meric species.",topology
"Quite surprisingly a differentpicture emerged when, in a sepa-rate set of experiments, a mixtureof dialdehydes Band Dwastreated with triamine X. In thiscase no peak corresponding toD3X2was observed rather thancage B3X2. The same story iterat-ed when aldehyde Bwas treatedScheme 1.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licenseand Piggott[18]in the early 20th century, it proceeds througha symmetry-forbidden [2 +2] cycloaddition reaction via the for-mation of a concerted 1,3-diazetidine intermediate. A few de-cades later Messmer[19]showed that catalyst is required for theprogress of the reaction as it goes through an ionic intermedi-ate. So the next question that comes to mind is: would suchimine exchange be possible in covalent cages? If so, thenhow? To reach this goal, we have revisited our recent work,[14]and two previously synthesized non-self-sorted cages ( E3Y2and G3X2) have been selected. A solution containing cagesE3Y2and G3X2in CDCl3was stirred at room temperature with-out adding any catalyst (Scheme 6) and the progress of the re-action was monitored by1H NMR spectroscopy (Figure S36 inthe Supporting Information). Investigation throughout the re-action progress suggested slow exchange of partners and theformation of the desired two cages ( E3X2and G3Y2), but unex-pectedly we also observed peaks assigned to aldehydes FandG. This experimental outcome opposes the conventional imineexchange pathway and rather we anticipated that it followsa two-step process: disassembly into aldehydes and aminesfollowed by reassembly by the process of self-sorting. We be-lieve that dissolved water in CDCl3is responsible for the trans-formation. Theoretical calculation (DFT, B3LYP , 6-31G) predictsthat thermodynamically this process is possible, as it gains/C03.84 kcal mol/C01extra stability.",topology
"Solid-state structural examination elucidates that in all casesthree molecules of aldehyde reacted with two molecules ofamine to form [3+2] self-assembled cages in which iminebonds are, as expected, in the preferred trans conformationwith C =N bond lengths in the range of 1.26¨C1.28 /C138 (seeFigure 6). Aldehyde groups adopted an antiparallel alignmentwith respect to each other during the formation of the desiredcages. In the case of cage B3X2, strong intramolecular H¡¤¡¤¡¤N hy-drogen bonds are found to occur between imine nitrogen andthe hydroxyl groups. This fact is reinforced by the O /C0N distan-ces between hydroxyl groups and the imine nitrogen atoms,which are in the range of 2.52¨C2.58 /C138. The distance betweentwo central nitrogen atoms of amine Xin cages A3X2and B3X2is/C2517 /C138 whereas, due to lack of ethynyl functionality in alde-hyde D, cage D3X2is slightly smaller in size with a distance of/C2514 /C138. Some of the selected bond lengths and angles arelisted in the Supporting Information (Table S1).",topology
