"As shown in Figure S8, satisfactory separation of triamine compounds could be obtained on CHIRALPAL column IA under optimized mobile phase (see Section 2 for details). Four major peaks were observed in the elution curve of the reaction mixture of the ring-opening amination of (rac)-2a, whose retention times locate around 21.5 min (12.7%), 23.3 min (12.5%), 26.1 min (37.7%), 32.9 min (37.1%). The experimental results are consistent with the ideal product distribution, where homochiral (3R)-2b and (3S)-2b each account for 1/8, and heterochiral (2R1S)-2b and (1R2S)-2b each account for 3/8. After purification, racemic triamine compounds rac-2b and hetero-2b were successfully separated, corresponding to two minor peaks at 21.1 min and 22.9 min as well as two major peaks at 26.0 min and 32.9 min, respectively. Through the further comparison experiments, rac-2b was definitely determined to be the racemic mixture of enantiopure (3R)-2b and (3S)-2b. Combining chiral HPLC chromatograms and 1H NMR spectrum, it could be concluded that the hetero-2 is a racemic mixture consisting of (2R1S)-2b and (1R2S)-2b.S227.
