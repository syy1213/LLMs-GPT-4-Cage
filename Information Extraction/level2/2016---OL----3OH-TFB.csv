Previous  report9 on related N-salicylideneanilines indicates that there exists a degree of resonance stabilization capable of overcoming the los s of aromaticity in the phenyl ring, and this can stabilize the keto -enamine form. The stability of the corresponding imine tautomer was estimated by calculating the energy difference between the DFT -optimized structures of the tautomers. In our case, addi tional question arises regarding the experimental preference of the formation of [2+3] systems over the [4+6] cages. The possible reasons for this were sought computationally by comparing the energy of the [4+6] cage 4 with the doubled energy of the [2+3] system 8. The computational setup (DFT functionals, basis sets, pre -optimization with the MM+ force field) was the same as given above. The results are presented and discussed below.",topology,

These results show that, regardless of the presence of D3 dispersion correction and the choice of the functional, the keto -enamine tautomer is strongly preferred for the [2+3] -type compound 8 (in agreement with the experiment) as well as for the putative [ 4+6] cage 4. However, the experimental preference of the [2+3] system 8 over the putative [4+6] structure 4 is reproduced by calculations only for the keto -enamine case, and only when the dispersion correction is taken into account. Even then, the preferen ce is small ¨C 1.48 or 2.26 kcal/mol, depending on the exchange -correlation functional. The calculated values are, however, differences of total energies, not (free) energies or enthalpies. This might suggest the role of the entropic factor leading to the p reference of the formation of two molecules of 8 over one molecule of 4. These thermodynamic considerations do not rule out possibility of kinetic reason for the preference of the [2+3] over [4+6] systems.",topology,
Discussion of the role of entropic contribution influencing the preferred formation of [2+3] vs.,topology,
[4+6] keto -enamine condensation products and the reversibility of 2+3 keto -enamine formation.,topology,
"There is a remarkable difference in the preferred formation of [2+3] products 8 and 9 in the reaction of 1,3,5 -triformylphloroglucinol with chiral diamines vs. the pref erred formation of [4+6] products in the reaction of 1,3,5 -triformylbenzene and the same diamines. As discussed above, the preference of the [2+3] system 8 over the putative [4+6] structure 4 is reproduced by DFT calculations only for the keto -enamine case  (i.e. for both 4 and 8 existing in this tautomeric form), and only when the dispersion correction is taken into account. Even then, the preference is small ¨C 1.48 or 2.26 kcal/mol, depending on the exchange -correlation functional. The preference for the 30  smaller 2+3 is unlikely to resu lt from the different angular preferences or strain of the structure for the enol -imine tautomer vs. the keto -enamine tautomer. Actually, the MM+ molecular mechanic s calculation s of structures of 4 and 8 suggest that the putative 4+6 product 4 is energetically more favorable both when enol -imine or keto -enamine tautomeric forms  are compared  (24.3 and 11.2 kcal/mol respectively).",topology,
"It should be noted that the synthesis of the 2+3 products  8, 9 and 10 diffe rs from the synthesis of [4+6] cages based on 1,3,5 -triformylbenzene in the applied reaction conditions; the latter products were obtained at room temperature while the former products were obtained at elevated temperatures under reflux conditions. In gene ral, entropic contribution should favor the larger [4+6] product at lower temperatures and the smaller [2+3] product at higher temperatures.",topology,
"Attempts to obtain the designed [4+6] cage 4 from 3 and 5 at room temperature resulted in complicated mixture of pr oducts. Similar situation was also observed in other cases e.g. in the reaction  of 3 and 7 (Figure S20). In contrast to imine cages, the formation of keto -enamine products is much less reversible. The irreversible nature of the reaction of formation of ket o-enamines derived from the 1,3,5 -triformylphoroglucinol was observed before.1 In the case of reactions of 1,3,5 -triformylbenzene or 1,3,5 -triformylphloroglucinol with diamines such as DACH the difference in reversibility of these reactions is suggested b y the outcome of the reaction. In the case of the former, a single 4+6 imine product is formed in quantitative yield at room temperature after 12 h of mixing.2 In the case of the latter, a mixture of products is formed under similar conditions, while the dominant keto -enamine product is obtained under reflux conditions, although the system is still far from  equilibrium after short 30 min reflux (Figure S19). Similarly, w e have followed the time course of the condensation reaction  of 3 and 7 and found  that t he product  10 is formed  gradually (Figure S20)  and that for the reaction run at room temperature  it is only a minor component in the mixture of various  keto -enamine [n+m] products.  This lack of sufficient reversibility at room temperature prevents ¡°error c orrection¡±, which helps the formation of the symmetric thermodynamic product, and mixture of kinetic products is obtained instead .",topology,
