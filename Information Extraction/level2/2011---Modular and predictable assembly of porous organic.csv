Finally, a solution of (R,R ) -1,2-diaminocyclohexane (5 g, 44.64 mmol) in dichloromethane (100 mL) was added to this, again without mixing. The reaction was covered and left to stand. The absence of stirring is important since it controls the dissolution rate of the TFB: similar results can be obtained by slow addition, for example with syringe pump, although the layering method is convenient, reproducible, and scalable to multigram quantities.

"(iv) Cage 5-R was prepared as follows: an oven-dried round-bottom flask was cooled to room temperature under a dry nitrogen atmosphere. After tri(4-formylp henyl)amine (264 mg, 0.8 mmol) was charged into the flask, dichloromethane (100 mL) was added. The clear yellow-green solution that was formed was kept for the next step. To another oven-dried flask, also cooled to room temperature under N 2, was added (1R, 2R)-1,2-cyclopentanediamine dihydrocholoride (208 mg, 1.2 mmol), methanol (100 mL), and triethylamine (243 mg, 2.4 mmol). The clear, colorless solution was stirred at room temperature for 5 每10 min. This solution was then added very slowly to the first solution by pouring gently down the side of the flask to form two layers: a colorless layer on the top and a yellow-green layer at the bottom. A cloudy interface appeared between these two layers as the reaction progressed. The resulting suspension was then sealed and kept at room temperature for 7 days. A white solid which adhered to the walls of the flask was observed after 7 days, along with a clear yellow supernatant solution. The white solid was collected by filtration and washed with DCM (3 ℅ 5 mL) to afford pure cage 5 in 90% yield (305 mg).

After 3 weeks, clear single crystals suitable for X-ray structure determination were obtained. Other racemic crystals and quasiracemic cocrystals, such as ( 3-R, 3-S) and ( 4-S, 3-R), were formed by mixing together solutions in solvents such as chloroform or dichloromethane.

All rights reserved ?2011crystal (Fig. 1c) to give a porous solid with SA BET5873 m2g21.I nthis case, the chirality in both modules is fixed rather than dynamic. Asbefore, DFT simulations suggest a significant energy gain(19 kJ mol21) in the formation of heterochiral dimers. Again, thecrystal structure can be predicted ab initio . The experimentallyobserved racemic packing is the global energy minimum in the setof predicted crystal structures, and there is close agreement betweenthe predicted and observed structures (Fig. 3d). These calculations alsosuggest a global preference for heterochiral packing modes rather thanhomochiral. A large energetic gain, of 32 kJ mol21, is calculated for the(3-S,3-R) racemic crystal over the most stable predicted homochiralstructure for 3-R. The global-minimum homochiral prediction alsoclosely reproduces the observed structure for 3-R12(Fig. 3c), which,unlike 1, can be obtained from enantiopure solutions because 3-Rdoesnot interconvert with its enantiomer. As for the ( 1-S,3-R) co-crystal,the atom每atom lattice energy calculations were verified using periodicDFT calculations, which resulted in similar calculated energy differ-ences (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 13). An ana-logous set of experimental observations and crystal structurepredictions was obtained for a new cage module, 4-S, which has cyclo-pentane vertices rather than cyclohexane (Fig. 1a). This module formsa quasiracemic co-crystal, ( 4-S,3-R), with SA BET5980 m2g21. In thiscase, the predicted global-energy-minimum crystal structure is anordered version of the most probable site-disordered space-group-F4132 structure, according to powder X-ray data (SupplementaryFigs 12 and 15). By itself, 4-Sdoes not pack in a window-to-windowfashion (Supplementary Fig. 18). Hence, like ( 1-S,3-R), this packingmode is directed by the partner module, 3-R.",surface area
"The crystalline solid 5-Rhas larger pores (compare Fig. 1b, c withFig. 1d) and a greater pore volume (0.63 cm3g21) than any of thematerials produced from the smaller cages 1,3and4.

Cooper1Nanoporous molecular frameworks1每7are important in applica-tions such as separation, storage and catalysis. Empirical rules existfor their assembly but it is still challenging to place and segregatefunctionality in three-dimensional porous solids in a predictableway. Indeed, recent studies of mixed crystalline frameworks suggesta preference for the statistical distribution of functionalitiesthroughout the pores7rather than, for example, the functionalgroup localization found in the reactive sites of enzymes8. This isa potential limitation for ＆one-pot＊ chemical syntheses of porousframeworks from simple starting materials. An alternative strategyis to prepare porous solids from synthetically preorganized molecu-lar pores9每15. In principle, functional organic pore modules could becovalently prefabricated and then assembled to produce materialswith specific properties. However, this vision of mix-and-matchassembly is far from being realized, not least because of the chal-lenge in reliably predicting three-dimensional structures formolecular crystals, which lack the strong directional bonding foundin networks. Here we show that highly porous crystalline solids canbe produced by mixing different organic cage modules that self-assemble by means of chiral recognition. The structures of theresulting materials can be predicted computationally16,17, allowingin silico materials design strategies18. The constituent pore modulesare synthesized in high yields on gram scales in a one-step reaction.",this paper's author
