"By integration of typical regions (around d=9 ppm) atwhich the imine protons resonate, we estimated that thecage compound was formed in approximately 33% of thecollected precipitate, which corresponds to about 14% ofthe whole product library. It is assumed that the higher de-grees of rotational freedom of the two salicylaldehydic unitsconnected by an ethylene bridge causes a higher number ofreasonable possibilities in the virtual combinatorial li-brary,[19]which results in a higher number of mismatched oli-gomeric and polymeric byproducts. From this observation, itis concluded that rigid precursors with directed functionalgroups are beneficial for cage formation. This finding com-plements suggestions for other organic cage compounds,[a] Dipl.-Chem. M. W. Schneider, Dr. M.

"[1每9]With specific surface areas of upto 2071 m2g/C01,[5]these new materials complement existingsystems of polymeric porous structures, for example, metal每organic frameworks (MOFs),[10]covalent organic frame-works (COFs), and amorphous porous organic polymers.[11]One method to synthesize organic cage compounds inhigh yields is the reversible formation of multiple iminebonds.[12,13]Nevertheless, only some of those cage com-pounds have been reported to be permanently porous.[14]One of the first examples was introduced by the Coopergroup, who synthesized Td-symmetric cage compounds bycondensation of four molecules of 1,3,5-triformylbenzeneand six molecules of various 1,2-diamines (such cage com-pounds are usually termed [4+6] cages).[3]The Brunauer每Emmett每Teller (BET) surface areas of these first systemswere 624 m2g/C01. These materials could selectively adsorbvarious gases, for example, H2,CO2,o rC H4. Very recently,the same group synthesized a porous [4 +6] cage compoundwith a much higher specific BET surface area (1333 m2g/C01)by enlarging the trialdehyde used.[6]We used a complementary approach to synthesize [4 +6]cage compounds.[15]Triptycene triamine 1[16]was reactedwith salicyldialdehydes to give endo -functionalized adaman-toid cage compounds. These cage compounds show perma-nent porosity in the crystalline phases, with highly accessibleBET surface areas of up to 2071 m2g/C01.[4,5]These cage com-pounds could also selectively adsorb CO2(9.4 wt%) overmethane (0.98 wt%).[4]The above-mentioned unique sys-tems tend to have shape-persistent cavities due to the intrin-sic rigidity of the tetrahedral molecular scaffold.",surface area
"Recently, another type of connection was used to generateporous shape-persistent molecules through an imine conden-sation of trisamines and dialdehydes or trisaldehydes and di-amines, respectively, to give [2+3] cage compounds.[7每9]However, the reported BET surface areas (10 m2g/C01and99 m2g/C01) of these [2 +3] cage compounds are significantlylower than for the [4 +6] cage compounds, though a good se-lectivity for the adsorption of CO2over N2was reported.[7,8]The described [2 +3] cage compounds contain flexible link-ing units within the molecules that allow the molecularstructure of the cage compounds to twist so that the trigonalplanar subunits preferentially interact through p每pstackingand almost close the cavities, which leaves insufficient spaceinside the cage compound interior for gas sorption. Thiseffect might be the reason for the low measured BET sur-face areas.",surface area
"[23]This is typical for micro-porous systems, which do not change their structural consti-tution during gas uptake and release. The adsorbed amountof nitrogen gas was 286 cm3g/C01atP/P0=0.95. The calculatedBET surface area is 744 m2g/C01and the corresponding Lang-muir surface area is 835 m2g/C01. This is, to the best of ourknowledge, the highest surface area for a [2 +3] imine cagecompound and even higher than those reported for most ofthe smaller [4+6] cage compounds.[3]The pore volume(Vpore) is 0.26 cm3g/C01. The contribution of the micropore sur-face area on the total surface area was calculated to be 81%by using the t-plot method. By using NL-DFT methods, thepore-size distribution was found to be very narrow andshowed a maximum at 4.2 /C138.",surface area
"In contrast to cage compound 3a,3bseems to be of lowporosity: A sample of 3btreated as described above ad-sorbed only 25 cm3g/C01N2atP/P0=0.95. The determinedspecific surface area was 30 m2g/C01(BET model) or204 m2g/C01(Langmuir model), which is much lower than forcage compound 3a. From a t-plot analysis we concludedthat this measured surface area is basically not derived frommicropores, but rather from the bulk surface, which indi-cates that the pores are very small and the adsorption of ni-trogen at 77 K is kinetically hindered.",surface area
