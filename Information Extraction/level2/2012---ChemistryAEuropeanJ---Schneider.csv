"By integration of typical regions (around d=9 ppm) atwhich the imine protons resonate, we estimated that thecage compound was formed in approximately 33% of thecollected precipitate, which corresponds to about 14% ofthe whole product library. It is assumed that the higher de-grees of rotational freedom of the two salicylaldehydic unitsconnected by an ethylene bridge causes a higher number ofreasonable possibilities in the virtual combinatorial li-brary,[19]which results in a higher number of mismatched oli-gomeric and polymeric byproducts. From this observation, itis concluded that rigid precursors with directed functionalgroups are beneficial for cage formation. This finding com-plements suggestions for other organic cage compounds,[a] Dipl.-Chem. M. W. Schneider, Dr. M.

"[1¨C9]With specific surface areas of upto 2071 m2g/C01,[5]these new materials complement existingsystems of polymeric porous structures, for example, metal¨Corganic frameworks (MOFs),[10]covalent organic frame-works (COFs), and amorphous porous organic polymers.[11]One method to synthesize organic cage compounds inhigh yields is the reversible formation of multiple iminebonds.[12,13]Nevertheless, only some of those cage com-pounds have been reported to be permanently porous.[14]One of the first examples was introduced by the Coopergroup, who synthesized Td-symmetric cage compounds bycondensation of four molecules of 1,3,5-triformylbenzeneand six molecules of various 1,2-diamines (such cage com-pounds are usually termed [4+6] cages).[3]The Brunauer¨CEmmett¨CTeller (BET) surface areas of these first systemswere 624 m2g/C01. These materials could selectively adsorbvarious gases, for example, H2,CO2,o rC H4. Very recently,the same group synthesized a porous [4 +6] cage compoundwith a much higher specific BET surface area (1333 m2g/C01)by enlarging the trialdehyde used.[6]We used a complementary approach to synthesize [4 +6]cage compounds.[15]Triptycene triamine 1[16]was reactedwith salicyldialdehydes to give endo -functionalized adaman-toid cage compounds. These cage compounds show perma-nent porosity in the crystalline phases, with highly accessibleBET surface areas of up to 2071 m2g/C01.[4,5]These cage com-pounds could also selectively adsorb CO2(9.4 wt%) overmethane (0.98 wt%).[4]The above-mentioned unique sys-tems tend to have shape-persistent cavities due to the intrin-sic rigidity of the tetrahedral molecular scaffold.",surface area
"Recently, another type of connection was used to generateporous shape-persistent molecules through an imine conden-sation of trisamines and dialdehydes or trisaldehydes and di-amines, respectively, to give [2+3] cage compounds.[7¨C9]However, the reported BET surface areas (10 m2g/C01and99 m2g/C01) of these [2 +3] cage compounds are significantlylower than for the [4 +6] cage compounds, though a good se-lectivity for the adsorption of CO2over N2was reported.[7,8]The described [2 +3] cage compounds contain flexible link-ing units within the molecules that allow the molecularstructure of the cage compounds to twist so that the trigonalplanar subunits preferentially interact through p¨Cpstackingand almost close the cavities, which leaves insufficient spaceinside the cage compound interior for gas sorption. Thiseffect might be the reason for the low measured BET sur-face areas.",surface area
"[23]This is typical for micro-porous systems, which do not change their structural consti-tution during gas uptake and release. The adsorbed amountof nitrogen gas was 286 cm3g/C01atP/P0=0.95. The calculatedBET surface area is 744 m2g/C01and the corresponding Lang-muir surface area is 835 m2g/C01. This is, to the best of ourknowledge, the highest surface area for a [2 +3] imine cagecompound and even higher than those reported for most ofthe smaller [4+6] cage compounds.[3]The pore volume(Vpore) is 0.26 cm3g/C01. The contribution of the micropore sur-face area on the total surface area was calculated to be 81%by using the t-plot method. By using NL-DFT methods, thepore-size distribution was found to be very narrow andshowed a maximum at 4.2 /C138.",surface area
"In contrast to cage compound 3a,3bseems to be of lowporosity: A sample of 3btreated as described above ad-sorbed only 25 cm3g/C01N2atP/P0=0.95. The determinedspecific surface area was 30 m2g/C01(BET model) or204 m2g/C01(Langmuir model), which is much lower than forcage compound 3a. From a t-plot analysis we concludedthat this measured surface area is basically not derived frommicropores, but rather from the bulk surface, which indi-cates that the pores are very small and the adsorption of ni-trogen at 77 K is kinetically hindered.",surface area
"[25]Witha stiffer linker unit, we wereable to remove solvent and pre-serve the three-dimensionalpore structure, which resultedin high BET surface areas of744 m2g/C01.
