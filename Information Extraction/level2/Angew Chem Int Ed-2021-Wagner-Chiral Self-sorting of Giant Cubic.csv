Af ter purging with argon, the vial was sealed with a Teflon -lined cap and the reaction stirred at 100  ¡ãC for 1 6 h using a preheated oil bath. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature, poured onto a mixture of 2 M aqueous HCl (100  mL) and dichloromethane (100  mL) and stirred vigorously for 5  h to hydrolyze  the imium salt.

Selectivity of chiral self -sorting   In the 1H NMR spectrum of the self -sorting reaction small signals, which do not belong to the  [8+12] cage compounds ( P)/(M)-4 or (P,M)-4 could be observed.
