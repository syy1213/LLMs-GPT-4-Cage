Af ter purging with argon, the vial was sealed with a Teflon -lined cap and the reaction stirred at 100  ∼C for 1 6 h using a preheated oil bath. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature, poured onto a mixture of 2 M aqueous HCl (100  mL) and dichloromethane (100  mL) and stirred vigorously for 5  h to hydrolyze  the imium salt.
