"Results and DiscussionRational Design of Dissymmetric Cages Composed ofConformational EnantiomersFrom achiral precursors triamino-functionalized TABPBand trialdehyde-containing TP, wesynthesized aseries ofDC molecules with different alkyloxy groups oneachterphenyl pillar (Figure 1b), except forDC-1 without lateralmoiety.[30]EachDCmolecule iscomposed ofabenzene roof(inblue), atris(N-salicylideneamine) bottom (inyellow),and three terphenyl pillars. Inorder torelease the strainduring theformation ofacage, thethree pillars twist eitherclockwise ((P)-DC) oranti-clockwise ((M)-DC). Itthereforeyields amixture oftwo conformational enantiomers (calledatropo-enantiomers) with apropeller-like shape. The crys-tallographic analysis reveals that each enantiomer hasaC3-axis ofrotation asthe only element ofsymmetry, butwithout inversion center ormirror plane.

Materials Reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification, unless other indicated. 1,4-Dioxane and tetrahydrofuran (THF) was dried over sodium and distilled under nitrogen before use. Bis(pinacolato)diboron, 3'-bromoacetophenone, 3-aminobenzeneboronic acid, 1,3-dibromo-5-methoxybezene, bromoethane, 2-bromopropane, 1-bromobutane, phloroglucinol, formamidine acetate, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), lithium diisopropylamide (LDA, 2 mol/L in THF/heptane) and catalyst [1,1'-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene] dichloropalladium(II) [PdCl2(dppf)] were purchased from Adamas-beta, China. 3,5-Dibromophenol and catalyst tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium [Pd(PPh3)4] were purchased from Bidepharm, China. Thionylchloride (SOCl2) and inorganic salts including potassium carbonate, potassium acetate, sodium bicarbonate and magnesium sulfate were purchased from Greagent, China. Flash column chromatography was performed on silica gel (200¨C300 mesh) and the compounds were visualized under 254 nm on thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates.  2. Techniques 2.1 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 400 MHz and 101 MHz on a Bruker A V ANCE III HD 400 NMR spectrometer. NMR spectra were measured at 298 K in CDCl3, acetone-d6 or DMSO-d6. Their proton residuals are used as internal reference for 1H NMR, respectively. Proton and carbon chemical shifts (¦Ä) are reported in ppm and coupling constants (J) in Hertz (Hz). The multiplicity in the 1H NMR spectra are described as s (singlet); d (doublet); dd (doublet of doublets); t (triplet); q (quartet); m (multiplet); br (broad). 2.2 Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometry MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed on a Bruker Autoflex speed TOF/TOF mass spectrometer and operated in reflective mode. Internal calibration was S4  performed using peptide (700-3500 Dalton) as standards. The analytical samples were obtained by mixing the CHCl3 solution of the sample (5 mg/mL) and CH2Cl2 solution of the matrix (trans-2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propene]-malononitrile (DCTB, 10 mg/mL) in a 1/5 (v/v) ratio. The prepared mixture solution of the sample (1 ¦ÌL) was loaded on the MALDI-TOF plate and allowed to dry at 25 oC before the plate was inserted into the vacuum chamber of the MALDI-TOF instrument. 2.3 Single Crystal X-Ray Diffractometry (SC-XRD) The single crystal data of cages were collected on Bruker D8 VENTURE. The structures were solved by direct methods using the OLEX-2 software. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined using anisotropic thermal parameters.  2.4 Circular Dichroism (CD) Circular dichroism (CD) was performed with a JASCO J-1500 spectrometer. CD spectra of the solution of the cages were recorded in 1 mm quartz cuvettes at 25 oC after single crystals were picked up randomly and dissolved in 250 ¦ÌL of chloroform. A scan rate of 200 nm min?1 with a response time of 1 s and a bandwidth of 5 nm were adopted. Time-dependent CD spectra at different temperatures were performed with different time intervals and recorded in 1 mm quartz cuvettes using 1,1,2,2-tertachloroethane (C2H2Cl4) or anhydrous THF as solvent. A scan rate of 200 nm min?1 with a response time of 1 s and a bandwidth of 5 nm were adopted at each temperature.  2.5 Chiral High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Analytical chiral HPLC was conducted on a Shimadzu LC-20AD system using CHIRALPAK columns (0.46 cm I.D. ¡Á 25 cm L). Chromatographic condition for cages: IF column, eluent of CHCl3/hexane = 80/20 (v/v), flow rate of 0.6 mL min?1, UV detection at 295 nm at 30 oC. 3. Synthesis of Precursors and Cages The syntheses of all chemical compounds are described as follows. DC-1 was synthesized according to our previous literature.[S1] 2,4,6-Trihydroxybenzene-1,3,5-S5  tricarbaldehyde (TP) and 1,3,5-tris(3-bromophenyl)benzene (compound 1) were synthesized according to the literature procedure.[S2¨CS3] 1H and 13C NMR spectra of all compounds are listed after their synthetic procedures and their assignment are given in their NMR spectra in Section 10.",this paper's author
