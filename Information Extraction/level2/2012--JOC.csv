Structural variations in thebuilding blocks included the distance and angle between thetwo reactive sites (aldehyde or amine functional groups) andthe absence/presence of solubilizing chains. Computer modeling was utilized to determine and compare the thermodynamicstabilities of some of these COP structures. Furthermore, gas adsorption studies were performed to explore the potential of thesemolecular cages for gas separation, particularly carbon capture, applications.",this paper's author
