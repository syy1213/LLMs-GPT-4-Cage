"8The porosityof some POCs has been shown to match that of COFs.1,6b,9Accordingly, POCs have been exploited in applications that relyon their porous nature, such as gas sorption and separation,10molecular sieving,11sensing,12catalysis13or transport of ions.14However, contrary to COFs, studies that explore the elec-tronic properties of POCs are rather scarce. Yet, organic cagesrepresent well-de 祈ned molecular architectures with buildingblocks arranged spatially with high precision, which is animportant requirement for electronic materials. As a result,properties that typically arise from the interplay of the inter-molecular electronic coupling between molecules in the solid-state could potentially emerge within a single cage due to itsthree-dimensional structure. Importantly, the incorporation ofchromophores or redox-active molecules could also allow theinvestigation of their mutual electronic communication both ina solution or in the solid-state.aDepartment of Chemistry, University of Basel, St. Johanns-Ring 19, CH-4056 Basel,Switzerland.

"Only cages 1aand 1bcould be synthesized in a large enoughquantity to perform these studies. Initial gas sorption analysisusing Ar or N2at 77 K with samples obtained from nitrobenzenedisplayed a low porosity (Fig. S60 ?). We attribute this result tothe residual nitrobenzene molecules blocking the voids evena徇er the activation of the samples under dynamic vacuum at120/C14C for 24 h because of the high boiling point of nitroben-zene (Fig. S64 ?). We reasoned that the cages crystallized fromTHF would allow us to remove the solvent molecules from thepores more e ?ectively. Indeed, we observed a signi 祈cantincrease in the BET surface areas (Fig. 3 and S60 ?). Cage 1ashowed a characteristic type I gas adsorption pro 祈le, an indi-cation for a highly microporous structure, with a BET surfacearea of 522 m2g/C01(Table 1). Further analysis of the adsorptionisotherm revealed that the micropores and external pores areresponsible for z60% and z40% of the total BET surface area,respectively. Interestingly, we observed almost no N2uptake atlow relative pressures for the PMDI cage 1buntil the pressurereached a value of p/p0z0.35, at which point a fast uptake of N 2occurred. Therefore, the BET surface area could not be quanti-祈ed in this case. In addition, we observed a non-closeddesorption isotherm without mesopore hysteresis for 1b. Thebehavior of 1bthus points to a gate opening phenomenonrelated to kinetic gas trapping, which is generally observed forso徇porous crystals and 祇exible porous cages.",surface area

Herein, we report the synthesis of a series ofchiral imine organic cages with three built-in rylene units by means of dynamic imine chemistry and weinvestigate their textural and optoelectronic properties. Thereby we demonstrate that the synthesizedrylene cages can be reversibly reduced at accessible potentials, absorb from UV up to green light, areporous, and preferentially adsorb CO2over N 2and CH 4with a good selectivity. In addition, wediscovered that the cage incorporating three perylene-3,4:9,10-bis(dicarboximide) units displays ane?cient delayed ?uorescence. Time-correlated single photon counting and transient absorptionspectroscopy measurements suggest that the delayed ?uorescence is likely a consequence ofa reversible intracage charge-separation event.

"Results and discussionSynthesis and propertiesThe structure of the cages 1requires that a ditopic amine anda tritopic aldehyde react in a [3 + 2] condensation reaction(Scheme 1). Previously,19we synthesized 1aby re 祇uxing thediamine 2awith benzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde in tolueneunder Dean 每Stark conditions. However, this approach was notsuitable for the synthesis of 1cbecause the correspondingdiamine 2chas a very low solubility in toluene. Although, thecage formation could be detected by MALDI-TOF, a majority of2cformed an insoluble 祈lm leading to negligible yield andimpure samples. Generally, PDIs have a lower solubilitycompared to the NDI or PMDI derivatives. Therefore, we per-formed DFT calculations to estimate the relative stabilities of 1band 1cusing an isodesmic reaction shown in Scheme S1 ?priorto the synthesis. We found that all cages display similar stability(Table S1 ?) even when the solvent environment was included,which promised a successful synthesis of 1band 1c. The ther-modynamic control of imine formation demands that thestarting compounds are soluble to drive the equilibrium to theproducts. We therefore tried to synthesize 1ain dry chloroform,in which the diamines 2possess a su ?cient solubility.
