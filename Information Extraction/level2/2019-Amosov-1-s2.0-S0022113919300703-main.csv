"4. ExperimentalThe19F and1H NMR spectra were recorded from solutions in CDCl 3on a Bruker AV300 spectrometer at 282.36 MHz and 300 MHz respec-tively,13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX-500 instrument(125.8 MHz). Chemical shifts are given in 汛 ppm from CCl 3F (19F) andTMS (1H,13C), J values in Hz; C 6F6(每162.9 ppm from CCl 3F), CHCl 3(7.24 ppm from TMS), CDCl 3(76.9 ppm from TMS) were used as in-ternal standards. IR spectra were taken on a Bruker Vector 22 IRspectrophotometer.The X-ray diffraction experiment for 4a*0.54(CCl 4),7*3C 6H6wascarried out on a Bruker KAPPA APEX II diffractometer with graphitemonochromated MoK汐 radiation at 296 and 200 K accordingly. Thestructures were solved by direct methods using the SHELXS-97 program[20]. Refinement was carried out using the full-matrix least-squarestechnique using SHELXL [20]. All non-hydrogen atoms were refinedanisotropically. Hydrogen atom positions were calculated geometricallyand refined using the riding model. Disordered CCl4with partially oc-cupied position 0.54 in 4aand disordered benzene molecules in 7wererefined with restrictions.
