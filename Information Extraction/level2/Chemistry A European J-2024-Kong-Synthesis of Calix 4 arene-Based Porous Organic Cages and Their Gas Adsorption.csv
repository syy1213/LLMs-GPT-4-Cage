"Synthesis of CHO -C4A: CHO -C4A was synthesized by the previous literature with a modified procedure.[24] Hexamethylene tetramine (6 g, 42.8 mmol) w as added into 40 mL trifluoroacetic acid with 25,26,27,28 -tetrahydroxycalix[4]arene (0.5 g, 1.2 mmol) to heated to reflux for 24  h. The resulting reactants were then cooled and stirred with hydrochloric acid (1.0 mol/L, 100 mL) and dichloromethane (75 mL) for 6 h. The organic layer was separated and washed with deionized water (50 mL) twice to get solvent evaporat ion under reduced pressure.

As shown in Figure 1,  1-aldehyde -4-hydroxy -calix[4]arene (CHO -C4A), a conical calix[4]arene with four aldehyde groups on the upper -rim, and tris(4 -aminophenyl)amine (TAPA) or 1,3,5 -tris(4 -aminophenyl)benzene (TAPB), a rigid triangular triamine, were self-assembled though the Sc hiff base reaction to form stoichiometric [6+8] type organic cages (named C4A -TAPA and C4A-TAPB, collectively called C4A-POC s).",topology
"The configuration of the individual cage was predicted, based on the geometry and binding mode of the pre -designed building blocks. Generally, when conical C4A assembles with linear units, the resulting products exhibit diverse configurations including edge-directed cages such as [2+4] dimers, [3+6] triangular prisms, and [6+12] truncated octahedrons (Fig ure S1).[4e] Alternatively, they may form spatially extended two -dimensional layered structures.[12] However, if C4A assembles with planar triangular units , like TAPA or TAPB, it is highly probable that the truncated octahedral organic cages with a stoichiometry of [6+8] will be formed (Fig ure 1).",topology
"However, the acquisition of a single crystal sample presents a formidable challenge due to the substantial molecular weight of this molecular cage, which hinders the determination of accurate  crystal structure data.  At present, only two SC -XRD data of the similar large -sized POC s are reported by Yuan Daqiang¡®s group[11c]. Nevertheless, matrix -assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight  (MALDI -TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry can determine the relative molecular mass of the reaction product, which is usually employed  to verify the existence of the discrete cages.[14] The MALDI -TOF-MS spectra of C4A -POC s (Fig ure 2e) were collected by dissolving them in DMSO. The major ion signals of C4A -TAPA and C4A -TAPB are m/z 5109.0 and m/z 5594.2, which correspond to the theoretical relative molecular weight of [6+8] cage s (calc. C 336H240O24N32: m/z 5109.7 for C4A -TAPA and calc. C 384H264O24N24: m/z 5598.4 for C4A -TAPB). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig ure 2f) show that C4A -POC s are spherical particles , and C4A -TAPB is a uniform nanoparticle with a diameter of less than 100 nm.  The thermogravimetric  analysis (TGA) in Fig ure S2 shows that C4A -POC s do not substantially lose weight until the temperature rises to 400 ?C, demonstrating their high thermal stability.",topology
"Conclusion  In summary , we propose that when the four-jaw conical C4A units meet  the triangular structural blocks, they tend to t ake place  the face-directed self -assembly process , resulting in the formation of  octahedral  cages with the stoichiometry of [6+8] . This statement  indicates the highly structural predictability of C4A -POCs and supports  the design strategy for organic cages based on C4A -CHO and p lanar triamine s. We have successfully implemented this idea and synthesized two large -sized POCs , namely C4A -TAPA ( C336H240O24N32) and C4A -TAPB ( C384H264O24N24). The PXRD analysis reveal s the crystalline  characteristics  of the two C4A-POCs ; however , precise crystallographic data are unavailable due to the absence of a single crystal sample . The formation of the large cages is confirmed through their relative molecular mass measured using MALDI -TOF/TOF spectra.",topology
