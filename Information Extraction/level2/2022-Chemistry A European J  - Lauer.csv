"HRMS experiments were carried out on a Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer ApexQe  (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen,  Germany) equipped with a 9.4 T superconducting magnet equipped  with an Apollo II MTP ion source which can be switched from ESI to MALDI operation . MALDI -TOF MS experiments were carried out on a Bruker AutoFlex Speed  TOF with DCTB ( trans -2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl) -2-methyl -2-propenylidene]malononitrile)  as matrix.  Elemental an alysis was performed by the Microanalytical Laboratory of the University of Heidelberg using an Elementar vario MICRO cube  machine. Crystal structure  analysis was accomplished on a STOE Stadivari diffra ctometer with a copper source ( Cu K¦Á = 1.54178  ?) or a Bruker APEX II Quazar diffractometer with a molybdenum source (Mo K¦Á = 0.71073 ?).

"Br-Ph cage (20)  After 14 days the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. Water (50 mL) was added and the suspension was treated in a supersonic bath for 15 minutes to obtain a homogenous suspension. The  S18   suspension was filtered and washed with water (2 ¡Á 25 mL) and  MeCN (25 mL). The solid residue was dissolved in boiling DMSO (20 mL), filtered and left undisturbed for 5 days. The obtained fine needles were collected by f iltration and washed with cold MeCN to give 80 mg (33%) of Br-Ph (20) as a colourless solid .
