"Therefore, both cage compounds have been investigated by gas sorption. Thermal treatment (120 oC for 3 h) under vacuum led not to a reasonable activation of the pores. In each case, the apparent specific surface area (Brunauer -Emmett -Teller model) never exceeded 11 m2/g (3-Et-Et) or 27 m2/g (3-Et-H) as measured by nitrogen sorption at 77 K. Because the pore -windows of both cages are narrow, we exchanged solvent first with n -pentane at room temperature,[29] sonicated the immersi on for 15 min, before exchanging with liquid ethane at 157 K for 10 min and activated at 40 oC in vacuum. Comparison of PXRD patterns show in both cases that the materials activated with ethane are much more crystalline than in case of thermal activation a nd the sample of cage 3-Et-H show very distinct sharp peaks (see Supporting Information). Additionally, the crystalline character is also confirmed by secondary electron micrographs (see Fig. 1).",surface area
"The activated sample of cage compound 3-Et-Et adsorbed 58 cm3/g N 2 at 77 K. The isotherm can best be described as a mixture of type I (microporous) and type II (non - or macroporous).[30] By NL-DFT, a broad distribution of pores is calculated.

"In conclusion, it was shown that the rotational freedom of C sp2-Csp3-bonds at least in one of the precursors needs to be highly restricted for the formation of [4+4] imine cages with truncated tetrahedral geometry. The geometrical pre -orientation of reacting groups is crucial, because the cage formation is kinetically controlled. The thermodynamic products are less structurally ordered polymers , which are formed as soon as an acid is present. Both cages were investigated by gas sorption. Whereas thermal activation led to more amorphous and less porous materials, mild activa tion by exchange with first n -pentane and then liquid ethane gave significantly higher BET surface areas up to 443 m2/g for cage 3-Et-H and a  high degree of crystallinity was maintained.",surface area

Lauer,[a] Wen-Shan Zhang,[b] Frank Rominger,[a] Rasmus R. Schr?der,[b] and Michael Mastalerz*[a]  Abstract : The synthesis of s hape -persistent organic cage compounds  is often based on the usage of multiple dynamic covalent bond formation (such as imines) of readily available precursors. By careful choice of the precursors geometry, the geometry and size of the resulting cage can be accurately designed and indeed a num ber of different geometries and sizes have been realized to date. Despite of this fact, little is known about the precursors conformational rigidity and steric preorganization of reacting functional groups on the outcome of the reaction. Herein, the influe nce of conformational rigidity in the precursors on the formation of a [4+4] imine cage with truncated tetrahedral geometry is discussed.",this paper's author

For thin layer chromatography s ilica gel 60 F254 plates from Merck were used and examined under UV-light irradiation (254 nm and 365 nm). Flash column chromatography was performed on silica gel from Sigma -Aldrich (particle size: 0.04 -0.063 mm) using petroleum ether, dichloromethane, chloroform, toluene, methanol, acetone and/or ethyl acetate. Melting points (not co rrected) were measured with a B¨¹ chi Melting Point B -545. IR-Spectra were recorded on a B ruker Tensor 27 spectrometer on a ZnSe  ATR crystal. NMR spectra were taken on a Bruker D RX 300 (3 00 MHz), Bruker Avance 300  III (300 MHz) , Bruker Avance  III 400 (400 MHz), Bruker Avance  III 500 (500 MHz)  and Bruker Avance  III 600 (6 00 MHz) spectrometer.",this paper's author

"Shape -persistent covalent organic cage compounds and capsules are interesting target molecules, mainly because of the ir defined and precisely confined interior space, which can be used to host guest -molecules of different sizes  or for gas sorption .[1] If the host -guest binding occurs selectively, the shape -persistent organic cages can be used e.g. for the molecular separ ation of (gas) mixtures either in the bulk,[2] by embedding the cages  into membranes ,[3] fill stationary columns with them for gas chromatographic purposes,[2a, 4] or ¨C more sophisticated ¨C to create porous liquids.[5] Thin films of shape -persistent organi c cages have been deposited on quartz crystal microbalances for selective gravimetric sensing.[6],[7] Organic cages have also been used for sensing in solution by selective fluorescence quenching in the presence of explosives.[8]  To efficiently synthesize  shape -persistent organic cages in high yields dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) turned out to be the synthetic method of choice.[1a, 1b]  Cages of various sizes and geometries should be accessible by choosing the right precursors.[9] And indeed a large numb er of geometries and topologies have been realized till date including prisms,[10] tetrahedra,[11] cubes,[2c, 12]  cuboctahedra ,[13] octahedra,[14]  tetrapods[15] and others.[16]  However, the influence of the precursors degree of rigidity and pre-orientation of functional groups to achieve the formation of shape -persistent organic cages is still not much investigated and fully understood.[17] We and others suggested that these precursors need to be well -chosen and sometimes subtle changes leads  to a complete failure of cage synthesis.[18] For instance, Cooper et al. studied the effect of connecting aliphatic tethers of different lengths of diamines in the imine condensation with aromatic trialdehydes.[19] Supported by theoretical calculations, a n even -odd effect was predicted and confirmed in the product mixture, although the overall amount of non -defined by-products was still very high.[19] A similar effect was investigated for cages stabilized by keto -enol tautomerization by the Banerjee group.[20] Mukherjee et al. investigated self -sorting of a four component system based on precursors felxibility and demonstrated that only the cages are formed with at least one rigid component involved.[21] Our group for instance investigated the degree of int rinsic flexibility of  ¡®linear¡¯ bis -salicylaldehydes in the formation of [2+3] imine cages.[10a] In case of the flexible precursor the formation of defined [2+3] cages was significantly lower in yield.",topology
"Here, we present our initial studies on the formation of [4+4] imine cages with a truncated tetrahedral geometry by a twelve -fold condensation of triamines and trialdehydes; focusing on the influence of precursors rigidity and pre -orientation of functional groups on cage formation (Scheme 1).",topology

"Therefore, purification by extraction with DCM was possible to isolate [4+4] imine cage 3-Et-H in 27% yield. The cage 3-Et-H was characterized by NMR spectroscopy, MALDI MS ( m/z = 1430.817 [M+H]+) and single -crystal diffraction analysis (see discussion below). By DOS Y experiments in C 6D6 (T = 298 K) a diffusion coefficient of D = 4.17 ¡¤10-10 m2s-1 was measured, corresponding to a solvodynamic radius of rs = 0.87 nm.",topology
