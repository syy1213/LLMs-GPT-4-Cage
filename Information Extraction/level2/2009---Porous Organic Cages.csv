"The primary synthetic challenge is to prepare permanentlyporous organic crystals assembled using non-covalent forces, whichare much weaker than the directional bonding in crystallinenetworks such as covalent organic frameworks4,17,18. We show thattetrahedral organic cages can be synthesized and subsequentlydesolvated to generate porous crystals that adsorb small gasmolecules, such as nitrogen, hydrogen, methane and carbondioxide. The crystal porosity in these materials is a consequence ofboth the molecular voids in the cages and the inefficient packing1Department of Chemistry and Centre for Materials Discovery, University of Liverpool, Crown Street, Liverpool L69 7ZD, UK,2Corporate Research &Development Division, Kaneka Corporation 5-1-1, Torikai-Nishi, Settsu, Osaka 566-0072, Japan,3I11 Beamline, Diamond Light Source Limited, HarwellScience and Innovation Campus, Chilton, Didcot OX11 0DE, UK,4School of Chemistry, University of St Andrews, North Haugh, St Andrews KY16 9ST, UK.",affiliation

"Synthesis of Cage 3 1,3,5-Triformylbenzene (81 mg, 0.5 mmol) was dissolv ed in dichloromethane (3 mL) and added to a solution of (R,R)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane (85 mg, 0.75 mmol)  in dichloromethane (3 mL). After 2 days at room temperature, transparent prism-li ke crystals were formed. The solvent was decanted, and fresh dichloromethane (3 mL) added which was then quickly decanted. A further aliquot of dichloromethane (8 mL) was added and the solution stirred to re-dissolve the crystalline material, filtered through a 200 nm PTFE filter  (Millex-FG) and the solvent allowed to evaporate to afford a white, microcrystalline powder in low yield (25 mg, 18 %). Crystals suitable for X-ray crystallography were either remove d directly from the reaction flask after 2 days prior to the washing step described above or, alternatively, by carrying out the reaction in chloroform instead of dichloromethane and simply allowing the solvent to evaporate slowly over several days.",comprehensive synthesis
"Porous materials are important in a wide range of applications including molecular separations and catalysis. We demonstratethat covalently bonded organic cages can assemble into crystalline microporous materials. The porosity is prefabricatedand intrinsic to the molecular cage structure, as opposed to being formed by non-covalent self-assembly of non-poroussub-units. The three-dimensional connectivity between the cage windows is controlled by varying the chemical functionalitysuch that either non-porous or permanently porous assemblies can be produced. Surface areas and gas uptakes for the latterexceed comparable molecular solids. One of the cages can be converted by recrystallization to produce either porous ornon-porous polymorphs with apparent BrunauerÃ¿EmmettÃ¿Teller surface areas of 550 and 23 m2g1, respectively. These resultssuggest design principles for responsive porous organic solids and for the modular construction of extended materials fromprefabricated molecular pores.",surface area

"The molecular nature of these organic cages permits solutionprocessing into a variety of forms. For example, we have foundthat 1, which is formally non-porous as synthesized from ethylacetate ( SABETD24 m2g1), can be recrystallized from a mixtureof dichloromethane and o-xylene to form a permanently porouspolymorph ( SABETD550 m2g1;Fig.6). Le Bail fitting of powderX-ray diffraction data obtained after desolvation of this polymorphsuggests a similar packing mode to that observed for cage2but with reduced symmetry (Supplementary Fig. S39).
