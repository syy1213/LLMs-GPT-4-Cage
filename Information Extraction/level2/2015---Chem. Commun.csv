"The selective formation of a single isomer of a [3+2] self-assembledorganic cage from a reaction mixture of an unsymmetrical aldehydeand a flexible amine is discussed.

"For an in-depth understanding of this subject, we thought tomonitor ( in situ )t h er e a c t i o nb e t w e e na l d e h y d e Band amine Xina step-wise fashion. Therefore 3 equiv. of Bwas first treated with1e q u i v .o fa m i n e Xin CDCl3at room temperature for 24 hours(Scheme 2). The1H NMR spectrum (Fig. S16, ESI ?)o ft h er e a c t i o nmixture after the said time period suggested that the formyl groupadjacent to the hydroxyl moiety ( meta -aldehyde) selectively reactedwith the amine to form the corresponding [3+1] assembly (imine¨Caldehyde compound). X-ray crystallographic analysis of the assem-bly unambiguously justified thi s observation. The preference ofthe amine for the meta -aldehyde could be attributed to the higherreactivity of the formyl group and the thermodynamic stability ofthe resulting assembly, owing to the intramolecular hydrogenbonding.",topology
"5bWhen the resulting [3+1] assembly was further allowedto react with 1 more equiv. of amine Xin CDCl 3at roomtemperature, we observed again the formation of a mixture ofisomers ( IandII) rather than the selective formation of isomer I(which was expected) (Scheme 2), as evidenced by the protonNMR spectra (Fig. S17, ESI ?). These experimental findingsclearly suggest that, though intramolecular hydrogen bondinghas an important role to play during the self-assembly process,the selective formation of only one isomer at room temperatureis not possible in the case of aldehyde B.",topology

Yellow block-shaped single crystals of the [3+1]imine¨Caldehyde compound B3XIwere crystallized from thereaction mixture by the slow evaporation of CHCl 3in a trigonalcrystal system with the space group P%3c1. In a similar fashion,crystals of [3+1] assembly C3XIwere also obtained.

"In conclusion, we have explored the possibility of usingunsymmetrical building units for constructing organic cagesusing dynamic covalent chemistry. Interestingly, the self-selectionof one isomeric cage out of two equally probable isomeric cageswas successfully achieved. Such a process is well supported byvarious spectroscopic techniques. The experimental findingssuggested that the formation of a selective isomer of a [3+2]oligoimine cage from a reaction mixture of an unsymmetricalaldehyde and a flexible amine depends on the shape and size ofthe building aldehyde. Theoretical calculations suggested thatthe energy di?erence between the isomers was the governingfactor in isomer selection, which correlates pretty well with thegeometric shape and size of the reacting aldehyde.",topology
