"＊RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe?rst employed a fragment coupling approach by takingadvantages of the three progressive and controllable reactionsites of cyanuric chloride.20Reaction of ( S)-binaphthol (( S)-1)with 2.5 equiv of cyanuric chloride ( 2) in THF at 0 ＜C withdiisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) as an acid scavenger a ?ordedthe trimer ( S)-3in an 89% yield ( Scheme 1 ). Macrocyclizationbetween equimolar amounts of ( S)-3and ( S)-binaphthol wentsmoothly in acetone at rt and gave the desired product of(S,S)-Min a 52% yield, which was better than that of areported protocol35(33% yield, acetonitrile as solvent). Thefurther reaction of the macrocycle with another equivalent of(S)-binaphthol in acetonitrile via heating at re ?ux for 12 h inthe presence of K2CO3a?orded ( S,S,S)-Cage in a high yield of85%.",comprehensive synthesis
"With the success of the fragment coupling approach, wewondered if a direct one-pot approach would work. To ourdelight both the macrocycle and the cage could be readilyobtained in even higher yields by just mixing ( S)-binaphtholand cyanuric chloride in a given ratio ( Scheme 2 ). Thereaction of a 1:1 mixture in DIPEA/acetone at rt for 4 da?orded the macrocycle in a 42% yield. The yield was furtherimproved to 63% under K2CO 3/CH 3CN conditions within ashorter time (12 h) ( Scheme 2 a). Alternatively, the reaction ofa 3:2 mixture under K 2CO 3/CH 3CN conditions via heating atre?ux for 12 h a ?orded the cage in a 91% yield ( Scheme 2 b)!The simple operation and high e ?ciency allow multigram-scalemacrocycle and cage products to be a ?orded very easily. Theenantiomers, namely ( R,R)-Mand ( R,R,R)-Cage ,w e r esimilarly synthesized from ( R)-binaphthol. All the productsare essentially enantiopure (>99% ee) as determined by chiralHPLC (see the Supporting Information ).",comprehensive synthesis

The single crystal of  rac-hetero -chiral cage  ((S,S,R )-Cage  + (R,R,S )-Cage ) was cultivated by slow diffusion  of n-hexane  to a racemic sample  solution in Cl2CHCHCl 2 at room  temperature.",this paper's author
