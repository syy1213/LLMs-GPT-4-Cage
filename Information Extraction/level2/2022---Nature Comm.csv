Materials and general methods All reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded at ambient temperature using Bruker AVANCE III 400/500  or Agilent DD2 600 spectrometers, with working frequencies of 400/500/600 and 100/125/150 for 1H and 13C respectively. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm relative to the residual internal non-deuterated solvent signals (for proton NMR, D 2O: 汛 = 4.70 ppm, CD 3SOCD 3: 汛 = 2.50 ppm). High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded on a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS).  CD spectra were recorded on a Circular Dichroism Spectrometer (Chirascan V100, Applied Photophysics Ltd).",affiliation
"ResultsSelf-assembly of the trefoil knot . A dicationic tetraaldehydeprecursor 12+﹞2Br每and (1 S,2S)-(+)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane((SS)-CHDA) were combined (Fig. 1A) in a 1:2 ratio in H 2O(1 mL). Here, H 2O was employed instead of D 2O, in order toavoid deuteration. After the mixture was heated at 80 ∼C for 12 h,the solution was cooled down to room temperature. CD 3SOCD 3(0.33 mL) was then added to the aqueous solution in order toperform1H NMR spectroscopic experiments. Both1H NMRspectrum (Fig. 2C) and ESI-HRMS (Supplementary Fig. S14)were recorded. ESI-HRMS reveals that a product, namely S-26+,containing three equivalents of 12+and six equivalents of ( SS)-CHDA, was obtained as the major product. Two predominantpeaks corresponding to [ 2每H]5+and [ 2+Br]5+were observedin the mass spectrum (Supplementary Fig. S14). The1H NMRspectrum shows a set of sharp resonances (Fig. 2C), indicatingthat the structure of S-26+is highly symmetrical. The assign-ments were con ?rmed by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy(Supplementary Figs. S6 每S13). The resonance corresponding tothe proton fin the biphenyl protons undergoes a signi ?cantup?eld shift of around 每2.4 ppm compared to the correspondingresonance in the precursor 12+(Fig. 2B). This result indicatesthat the biphenyl unit is buried deeply within the framework of S-26+and therefore experiences a shielded magnetic environment.",comprehensive synthesis

The corresponding reaction mixture was heated at 80 ∼C for 12 h. S-26+was self-assembled as the only observable product in the corresponding1H NMRspectrum, without further manipulation. The attempts to isolate the trefoil knot S-26+from its aqueous solution via counterion exchange proved unsuccessful,probably because imine bonds underwent degradation during these processes. Wealso tried to ?x the architecture of the trefoil knot by means of imine reduction.",comprehensive synthesis

"2. Synthetic procedures The precursor S1 was synthesized according to the procedure from the literature1. The procedure  is decribed as follows. 5-bromoisophthalaldehyde (3.00 g, 14.08 mmol) and pyridine-4-boronic acid (2.08 g, 16.90 mmol) were dissolved in a mixture of THF (180 mL) and 2 M aqueous potassium carbonate (42.2 mL, 84.5 mmol).The mixture was then degassed (N 2 bubbling, 30 min) before the addition of Pd(PPh 3)4 (325.2 mg, 0.28 mmol). The reaction was heated at 80 ∼C for 24 h. After cooling down the reaction solution to room temperature, the solvent was removed in vacuo.

"ARTICLEA trefoil knot self-templated through imination inwaterYe Lei1,6, Zhaoyong Li1,2,6, Guangcheng Wu1, Lijie Zhang3, Lu Tong1, Tianyi Tong4, Qiong Chen1,Lingxiang Wang1, Chenqi Ge1, Yuxi Wei1, Yuanjiang Pan1, Andrew C.-H. Sue4?, Linjun Wang1,2?,Feihe Huang1,5?& Hao Li1,5?The preparation of topologically nontrivial molecules is often assisted by covalent, supra-molecular or coordinative templates that provide spatial pre-organization for all components.Herein, we report a trefoil knot that can be self-assembled ef ?ciently in water withoutinvolving additional templates. The direct condensation of three equivalents of a tetraformylprecursor and six equivalents of a chiral diamine produces successfully a [3 +6] trefoil knotwhose intrinsic handedness is dictated by the stereochemical con ?guration of the diaminelinkers. Contrary to the conventional wisdom that imine condensation is not amenable to usein water, the multivalent cooperativity between all the imine bonds within the frameworkmakes this trefoil knot robust in the aqueous environment. Furthermore, the presence ofwater is proven to be essential for the trefoil knot formation. A topologically trivial macro-cycle composed of two tetraformyl and four diamino building blocks is obtained when asimilar reaction is performed in organic media, indicating that hydrophobic effect is a majordriving force behind the scene.https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31289-1 OPEN1Department of Chemistry, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, PR China.2Key Laboratory of Excited-State Materials of Zhejiang Province, ZhejiangUniversity, Hangzhou 310027, PR China.3Hangzhou Institute of Advanced Studies, Zhejiang Normal University, Hangzhou 311231, PR China.4College ofChemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, PR China.5ZJU-Hangzhou Global Scienti ?c and Technological Innovation Center,Hangzhou 310027, PR China.6These authors contributed equally: Ye Lei, Zhaoyong Li.?email: Andrewsue@xmu.edu.cn ;ljwang@zju.edu.cn ;fhuang@zju.",this paper's author

"Another question is that, what is the kinetic byproducts during the self-assembly? We thus performed the self-assembly of the trefoil knot at room temperature, in order to increase the life-time of the byproducts. Here, H 2O/CD3SOCD 3 (3:1, v/v) was used to avoid deuteration. Due to the instability of this intermediate, we were not able to isolate this compound and characterize it in a more conclusive manner. Mass spectrum (Supplementary Figure 27) clearly indicated the byproduct is a [4+8] compound, namely that it is composed of four equivalents of the tetraaldehyde and eight equivalents of the bisamine. The DOSY spectrum (Supplementary Figure 28c) clearly indicates that this [4+8] byproduct has a slightly smaller diffusion coefficient compared to the trefoil knot, implying that this byproduct has a slightly larger size or molecular weight compared to the trefoil knot ([3+6] product).   S23   1H NMR (Supplementary Figure 28b) spectra indicate that this [4+8] byproduct S-X8+﹞8Br每 is a Solomon link. In the 1H NMR spectrum, some of the resonances in this [4+8] byproduct also underwent remarkable upfield shift as occurred in the case of trefoil knot, indicating this [4+8] byproduct also has an intertwined architecture. Of course, it is also possible that the [4+8] byproduct is a [2]catenane composed of two [2+4] macrocycles. However, this [2+4] macrocycle contains two bulky ※speed bumps§.",topology
