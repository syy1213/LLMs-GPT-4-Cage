"Cage compounds 5a¨C5dwere investigated by nitrogensorption at 77 K to examine the impact of the introducedmoieties on the specific surface areas determined by theBrunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model. All samples weredegassed at 2008C and 6 /C148 10/C02mbar for 3 h, prior to themeasurement. As expected, with increasing bulkiness of theintroduced moieties, the specific surface area decreases. Forinstance, the propylated cage 5bgave a lower BET surfacearea (491 m2g/C01) than the methylated cage 5a(824 m2g/C01).",surface area
"The allylated cage 5cshowed a slightly lower specific surface(333 m2g/C01) than 5b. If the bulky benzyl substituent isintroduced, almost all of the voids interior is ¡°filled¡±, whichresults in a BET surface area of 119 m2g/C01. Investigating thematerials after performing the gas sorption experiments bypowder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) revealed that all thesamples are mainly amorphous (Supporting Information). Itwas reported before that the permanent porosity of peripherysubstituted [4+6] cage compounds is strongly depending onthe morphology,[7d,16]which encouraged us to obtain crystal-line material of the post-synthetic modified cage compounds.",surface area

"[20]We appliedthis method to crystalline 5ato desolvate the material atroom temperature (to give 5acr(rt)) and indeed, with1700 m2g/C01, the specific BET surface area is nearly doublethat of the amorphous material. It is worth mentioning, thatthis value is higher than for as-synthesized cage compound 3(1377 m2g/C01) but lower than for crystalline 3(2071 m2g/C01) andconsequently the second highest reported for intrinsicallyporous materials derived from organic molecules.",surface area
"[21]Consequently,surface area and pore-size have a major effect for theadsorption of non-polar gases, such as methane. As expected,the curve progression for the heat of adsorptions of methaneis very similar for both 3and 5acr(rt) with DHads(3)=40.7 kJmol/C01andDHads(5a)=36.1 kJmol/C01(Table 2). Thissuggests that only dispersion interactions are responsible andthe material with the higher specific surface area ( 3,2071 m2g/C01)[7d]shows a slightly better performance.",surface area

"In 2008, we introduced the one-pot synthesis of the endo-functionalized [4+6] cage compound 3by reacting fourmolecules of triamine 1and six molecules of salicyldialdehyde2(Scheme1).[14]What distinguishes this type of cage com-pounds from others, is that it bears six hydroxy groupspointing to the center of the cage cavity. This structural motif is very rare for organic cage compounds, and the functional-ization of the cages interiors through reaction at the hydroxygroups was to date unsuccessful. Herein we present a facilemethod for the post-synthetic modification of the intrinsicvoids in the cage compound, which allows the pore structureof the resulting material to be ¡°fine-tuned¡± in the solid state.",topology
