"95?97We found that these [2 + 4] dimericcages show considerably high CO2and C2H2capacities withthe range of 19 to 40 cm3g?1and 39 to 52 cm3g?1at roomtemperature (RT) ( Figures S49 ?S52), respectively, which aremuch higher than their calix[4]resorcinarene precursor whoseCO2uptake is 6.5 cm3g?1and C2H2uptake is 5.4 m3g?1at298 K ( Figure S49 ) and also those reported nonporousadaptive molecules have intrinsic cavities.98?101As for the [3 + 6] trimeric triangular prisms and [6 + 12]hexameric octahedrons, N 2adsorption measurements revealthat their isotherm shapes can be described as type I with asmall contribution from type II. Their isotherm curves showrapid uptake of N2gas at low pressure ( P/P0< 0.1), andfurther gradual uptake above P/P0= 0.1. The steep regions ofthe isotherm curves could be attributed to the micropore?lling, while the more gentle regions might be due to the gasadsorption into larger pores created from interparticle voids.Their maximum N2adsorption capacities at P/P0= 0.99 andBET values are listed in Table 2 , the latter of which are higherthan most of the reported POCs ( Figure 4 d).74?76,102?123Notall previously reported covalent organic cages provide gassorption data, which demonstrate permanent porosity in thesolid state; consequently, it is possible that some cages are, infact, porous but their sorption isotherms have not beenmeasured. The BET of CPOC-303 which is up to 2803 m2g?1presents the highest in POCs synthesized by Schi ?-basereactions, and only lower than the cuboctahedron [12 + 8]cage constructed from B ?O bond formation reaction, which isvery easily hydrolyzed and decomposes upon exposure tomoisture, thus limiting its wider applications. For all theseeight POCs, the hysteretic phenomena of desorption havebeen observed and might be ascribed to the interstices betweenthe cages in the solid state packing and the partially blockedapertures by the adjacent cages. This has been observed inother cage systems.",surface area
"¡öCONCLUSIONSIn summary, we have demonstrated the use of reticularchemistry in the preparation of three di ?erent types of novelcalix[4]resorcinarene-based POCs, including [2 + 4] dimericcages with odd ?even behaviors, unprecedented [3 + 6]trimeric triangular prisms, and largest recorded [6 + 12]hexameric octahedra, from the same tetraformylresorcin[4]-arene cavitand, by simply varying the diamine ligands. We havealso proposed a general method with which to obtain high-Figure 5.

In addition to the solid state X-ray crystaldeterminations, these cages are also characterized by1HNMR and high-resolution ESI ?TOF?MS in solution. Thiswork suggests that calix[4]resorcinarene can be an excellentbuilding block with which to prepare versatile molecule cageassemblies with continuously tunable window diameters from3.8 to 11.6 ?, and cavity volumes from 358 to 11243 ?3. Gassorption measurements suggest that they are all porousmaterials, especially for the [3 + 6] and [6 + 12] POCs withBET more than 1000 m2g?1, which exceeds that of themajority of POCs. To our knowledge, these cages present the?rst examples of POCs constructed from calixarene cavitands.",surface area
"The BET value of CPOC-303 is up to 2803 m2g?1, whichpresents the highest in POCs synthesized by Schi ?-basereaction. Notably, these POCs contain abundant functionalamines and phenol groups and ¦Ð-rich cavities, and may beexcellent porous materials for gas storage and separation, aswell as host ?guest chemistry. Moreover, the soluble nature ofthe calix[4]resorcinarene-based POCs suggested that they maybe promising materials in the construction of molecularlymixed composite membranes and porous liquids. Researchalong these lines is currently in progress.",surface area

A series of new POCs with dimeric cages withodd?even behaviors, unprecedented trimeric triangular prisms, and thelargest recorded hexameric octahedra have been prepared. These POCsare all constructed from the same tetratopic tetraformylresorcin[4]arenecavitand by simply varying the diamine ligands through Schi ?-basereactions and are fully characterized by X-ray crystallography, gassorption measurements, NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry.The odd ?even e ?ects in the POC conformation changes of the [2 + 4]dimeric cages have been con ?rmed by density functional theorycalculations, which are the ?rst examples of odd ?even e ?ects reportedin the cavitand-based cage system. Moreover, the ¡°V¡±shape phenylenediamine linkers are responsible for the novel [3 + 6] triangularprisms. The window size and environment can be easily functionalized by di ?erent groups, providing a promising platform for theconstruction of multivariate POCs. Use of linear phenylenediamines led to record-breakingly large [6 + 12] truncated octahedralcages, the maximum inner cavity diameters and volumes of which could be readily modulated by increasing the spacer length of thephenylenediamine linkers. This work can lead to an understanding of the self-assembly behaviors of POCs and also sheds light onthe rational design of POC materials for practical applications.",topology
"Herein, 11 new POCs with de ?nite crystal structures,showing distinct self-assembly behaviors and structuralcharacteristics, are presented. Speci ?cally, these POCs can bedivided into three di ?erent structure types, the [2 + 4] dimericcages with odd ?even behaviors, unprecedented [3 + 6]trimeric triangular prisms, and [6 + 12] hexameric octahedronswith very large cavities ( Scheme 1 ). They are synthesized witha Schi ?-based reaction by the combination of 4-connectedbowl-shaped tetraformylresorcin-[4]arene (C4RACHO) moi-eties and 2-connected diamine linkers. Due to the presence ofphenolic hydroxy groups in the C4RACHO units, the resultingimine (C¬­N) bonds can spontaneously convert by keto ?enoltautomerization into chemically more stable amine (C ?NH)bonds, which makes these POCs robust porous materials.",topology

"Self-Assembly and X-ray Crystal Structures of [2 + 4]Dimeric Cages. Four new amine-linked POCs, shown inFigure 1 a have been prepared by the Schi ?base reactionbetween C4RACHO and four ?exible alkanediamine analogueswith an increasing number of methylene groups. 1,3-Propane-diamine was used for CPOC-101 , 1,4-butanediamine forCPOC-102 , 1,5-pentanediamine for CPOC-103 , and 1,6-hexanediamine for CPOC-104 . X-ray analysis revealed thatCPOC-101 ,CPOC-102 , and CPOC-104 all crystallize in themonoclinic system with the space group I2/a, P21/n and P21/c, respectively; while CPOC-103 is triclinic with a P-1 spacegroup ( Figure 1 b).CPOC-104 is the ?rst example of cageslinked by such a long ?exible 1,6-diaminohexane residue. Eachcage molecule has one central cavity and four windows. Withthe increasing lengths of the alkanediamine, the volumes forCPOC-101 toCPOC-104 calculated by Voidoo,80?82increased from 358 to 581 ?3. In all of the crystal structures,the cage cavities and interstices all accommodate solventmolecules ( Figures S36 ?S39). All four crystal structurescon?rm the formation of the stick-shaped [2 + 4] cages, butthe arrangement of the two calix[4]resorcinarene units of acage is di ?erent in di ?erent crystal structures. In CPOC-101andCPOC-103 , two calixresorcin[4]arene cavitands maintaina gauche conformation, while in CPOC-102 andCPOC-104the calix[4]-resorcinarene units are superimposed in aneclipsed conformation. The gauche and eclipsed conformationchanges lead to much closer heights of CPOC-101 andCPOC-102 and of CPOC-103 andCPOC-104 . Although theodd?even e ?ect has already been observed in organic cagesystems, these are constructed from simple six-membered1,3,5-triformylbenzene and 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol withalkanediamines.",topology

"Self-Assembly and X-ray Crystal Structures of [3 + 6]Trimeric Triangular Prisms. In 1991, both the Warmuth andCram groups reported the Schi ?base reaction betweenmethylene-bridged tetraformylresorcin[4]arene cavitands andm-phenylenediamine to produce dimeric cages.84,85These cagestructures were characterized by NMR and mass spectrometry,but were not con ?rmed by X-ray crystal di ?raction. We used anone-bridged C4RACHO cavitand to react with m-phenyl-enediamine. Surprisingly, an unprecedented [3 + 6] trimerictriangular prism ( CPOC-201 ) was obtained ( Figure 2 a,b).",topology
"Speci?cally, using 2,4-diaminotoluene and 3,5-diaminobenzo-tri?uoride, two new triangular prisms, namely, CPOC-201-Meand CPOC-201-CF 3, respectively, can be prepared. Thesehave the same triangular prism shape as CPOC-201 , and alsocrystallize in the trigonal system, but in space group P-3 andP6122, respectively. Notably, with the introduction of thefunctional groups, their window diameters decreased from theoriginal 7.0 ? in CPOC-201 to 6.7 in CPOC-201-Me and 5.9?i n CPOC-201-CF3. These results suggest that it is possibleto use substituted m-phenylenediamine with bulky groups todecrease the windows further, and to prepare the Type 2porous liquids by dissolving them in solvents with bulkygroups.90,91On the basis of the above results of the analysis, itis revealed that the calix[4]resorcinarene-based POCs canprovide a new platform upon which to construct solublemultivariate materials, which are di ?erent from those reportedin MOF and COF systems.92,93Figure 2.

Am. Chem. Soc. 2020, 142, 18060 ?1807218063Reticular chemistry also o ?ers another strategy for system-atic expansion of the pores in MOF and COF materials byincreasing the length of the linkers. Interestingly, by using 4,4 ¡ä-diaminobenzophenone, a longer ¡°V¡±shape ligand, a largetriangular prism ( CPOC-202 ) whose window diameter isincreased to 7.4 ? and volume to 1710 ?3, has been obtained(Figure 2 c). The minimum and maximum cavity diameters ofCPOC-202 are 1.2 and 2.4 nm, respectively, and the maximumcavity diameter is much higher than that of the reported largestpillar[15]arene ( ¡«1.5 nm) and cucurbit[10]uril ( ¡«1.2 nm).",topology
"Porosity Characterizations for Calix[4]resorcinarene-Based POCs. To investigate the permanent porosity of theaforementioned POCs, crystalline samples of the organic cageswere immersed and exchanged ?ve times every 24 h in MeOHor pentane before drying at 100 ¡ãC under high vacuum. Thepermanent porosities of the activated samples were con ?rmedby N2gas sorption experiments at 77 K ( Figure 6 ). As for the[2 + 4] dimeric cages, the N 2adsorption experiments suggestthat all the cages do not adsorb signi ?cant amounts of N 2, andshow less porosity with low BET values ( Figure 6 a and Table1). The ?exibility of the alkanediamine linker and the absenceof proper connectivity between the voids in the solid crystalpacking result in their being barely porous. It has beenreported that molecular compounds with intrinsic cavities werecapable of encapsulating speci ?c gases and/or vapors by host ?guest interactions.",topology
"75,123?125For [3 + 6] triangular prisms, N 2gas sorption measurementsrevealed a slightly reduced N 2capacity and a BET surface areaof 1143 for CPOC-201-Me , which might be ascribed to thechannels blocking the methyl groups. However, the BET valueofCPOC-201-CF3is close to that of CPOC-201 , whichapparently is a compromise between the blocked groups andthe cavity volume. The channels of CPOC-201-CF3arehindered by the tri ?uoromethyl groups, but its cavity volume islarger than that of CPOC-201 . For both [3 + 6] and [6 + 12]POCs, the N 2capacities and BET surface areas aresubstantially increased with the increase of linker length.Notably, both of the [3 + 6] and [6 + 12] POCs are linked bythe rigid diamine linkers, but their surface area increases arenot proportional to their cavity volumes. This might beascribed to the cage structures transforming during theseprocesses, especially for the larger compounds ( CPOC-202 ,CPOC-302 , and CPOC-303 ), as determined by powder X-raydi?raction (PXRD; Figures S31 ?S33). The high surface areasof such cages may have the ability to absorb other gases, andthus the preliminary research based on CPOC-201 andCPOC-301 as examples was carried out. It was found that theyboth can take up gases including H2,C O2, and C2H2withnotably high capacities ( Figures S53 ?S58). Both CPOC-201andCPOC-301 show an uptake of ¡«1.6 wt % H2(¡«180 cm3g?1, 77 K and at 1 bar), which presents the highest in POCsystems.76,110?112Both CPOC-201 andCPOC-301 can takeup C2H2with capacities >75 cm3g?1(298 K and at 1 bar),which are even higher than most of the known porous organicframework materials.126,127Further examination of therelationships between the cavity shapes and/or window sizesand the gas separation abilities are currently in progress in ourgroup.",topology

With linear p-phenylenediamineand C4RACHO, a new structure type organic cage ( CPOC-301) can be formed. Single-crystal X-ray di ?raction analysisreveals that CPOC-301 belongs to the space group P-31mwithin the triclinic crystal system, and has an octahedralstructure. Within this structure, 6 molecules of C4RACHO actas the vertices, and 12 p-phenylenediamine molecules are theedges ( Figure 4 ). Its calculated minimum cavity diameter andvolume are 16.8 and 4270 ?3, respectively. This CPOC-301octahedron possesses eight trigonal ports with an averagelength of ¡«1.2 nm, and a maximum accessible pore windowdiameter of 7.0 ?. It is also able to introduce functional groupson its edges and thus modify its port size and environment(Figures S45 and S46 ). A sophisticated method would be tosystematically expand the pores in MOF and COF materials byincreasing phenylene ring of the linkers in reticular chemistry,but this has not been achieved in the POC systems. With thisin mind, we used the longer ditopic linear phenylenediaminelinkers, including 4,4 ¡ä-diaminobiphenyl (two phenylene rings)and 4,4 ¡å-diamino- p-terphenyl (three phenylene rings), andobtained the corresponding [6 + 12] hexameric octahedraCPOC-302 andCPOC-303 , respectively. Single-crystal X-raydi?raction analysis suggests that both CPOC-302 andCPOC-303crystallize in the trigonal system, and with space groups P-3c1 and R-3m, respectively. Notably, the minimum cavitydiameters and volumes for CPOC-302 andCPOC-303 haveincreased to 22.1 and 25.9 ?, and 7026 and 11243 ?3,respectively; while the average pore side lengths have alsoincreased to ¡«1.6 and ¡«2.0 nm.
