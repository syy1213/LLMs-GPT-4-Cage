"IR spectra  were recorded on a Fourier transform spectrophotometer equipped with a Ge ATR crystal. The absorption bands ¶Õ? are reported in cm-1 using the following abbreviations: vs = very strong, s = strong, m = medium, w = weak, vw = very weak. MS experiments  were carried out on a Fourier T ransform Ion Cyclotron Resonance mass spectrometer equipped with a 9.4  T superconducting magnet (Bruker ApexQe  hybrid 9.4 T FT -ICR) ( ESI), a Bruker Autoflex Speed MALDI -TOF mass spectrometer (MALDI -TOF, linear mode)  and a Bruker timsTOF Flex Ion Mobility -Quadrupole -Time -of-Flight mass spectrometer  (MALDI -Q-TOF) . For S2  measurements on the Bruker timsTOF , an external mass calibration for positive -ion mode was established based on phosphorus cluster ions generated by LDI from red phosphorus. Mass calibration of the instrument was  performed by automatic peak as signment to the reference list and application of the cubic enhanced algorithm of Bruker timsControl software (V 2.0) . All MALDI mass spectra were acquired using DCTB (trans -2-[3-(4-tertbutylphenyl) -2-methyl -2-propenylidene] malono nitrile) as a matrix . UV/VIS spectra  were recorded with a Jasco V -730 spectrometer and CD spectra  were recorded with a Jasco J -1500 CD spectrometer. Elemental analysis  was performed by the Microanalytical Laboratory of the University of Heidelberg using an Elementar Vario EL machine. Crystal structure analysis  was accomplishe d on a Stoe Stadivari diffractometer with a  gallium source ( ¶À(GaK ¶¡) = 1.34139  ?) and a PILATUS detector. Data processing and absorption correction (SADABS )S5 were accomplished by standard methods. The structure was  solved by direct  and Patterson  methods using XM/ SHELXD .S6 All non -hydrogen atoms were refined using anisotropic thermal parameters; hydrogen atoms were treated using appropriate riding models.

"S50  10. General procedure for the screening reactions and evaluation   Investigating  the catenane formation on small scale required the precise weighing of very small amounts of 1,4 -phenylenediamine (1.467  mg) to ensure good reproducibility. This problem was solved by using a stock solution of 1,4 -phenylenediamine according to the general  procedure detailed below. Unless mentioned otherwise,  a small excess of 1,4 -phenylenediamine (1.56  equiv vs. 1.50  equiv required for a stoichiometric ratio) was used  in all reactions . Details about the solvents used, etc. are described under the respectiv e screening experiments.",comprehensive synthesis
"General procedure:  A stock solution of 1,4 -phenylenediamine  2 in CHCl 3 (13.57  mM) was prepared by dissolving 1,4-phenylenediamine  2 (73.35  mg, 67.83  ¶Ãmol) in CHCl 3 (50 mL). The stock solution was  distributed into  reaction  vials (8 mL capacity) with 1 mL  of solution each , using an Eppendorf pipette . After removing the solvent under reduced pressure, the vials were purged with argon, capped and stored at -18 °„C until further use to prevent oxidation of 1,4 -phenylenediamine  2 by atmospheric oxygen.",comprehensive synthesis
"To perform a reaction, the enantiopure salicylaldehyde (+)-(M)-1 or (®C)-(P)-1 (4.8 mg, 8.69 ¶Ãmol, 1.0  equiv) was weighed using a sensitive analytical balance and added to a vial containing 1,4 -phenylenediamine  2 (1.47  mg, 13.57¶Ãmol,  1.56 equiv)  along with a cross -shaped stirring bar. After adding the solvent (see individual experiments for details) and a 0.1  M solution of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (11  ¶ÃL, 12  mol% based on the salicylaldehyde), the reaction vial was sealed with a Tef lon-lined cap  (no Ar -atmosphere) and stirred at 60  °„C for the time indicated using an aluminum block (stirring speed: 1000  rpm; when DCM was used as a solvent, the temperature was lowered to 50  °„C).",comprehensive synthesis
"After allowing the reaction to cool to r.t., the tip of a  spatula of solid NaHCO 3 was added , and the mixture was vigorously stirred for 10 min at r.t. leading to a color change from dark orange to yellow (neutralization of the TFA). The NaHCO 3 and any precipitate formed during the reaction were removed by filtra tion through a Pasteur pipette with a cotton plug. The solvent was removed from the filtrate using a rotary evaporator for low boiling solvents and a combination of high vacuum and a receiver chilled with liquid nitrogen  for high boiling solvents (T < 100  °„C; to avoid thermal decomposition).S9 After removing the solvent under vacuum, pentane was added to the remaining yellow solid. After standing for 30  min at r.t., the pentane was separated from the solid by decantation , and the solid was dried under high vacuum. This S51  workup -step removes  any remaining traces of high boiling solvents, that would complicate the evaluation of the 1H NMR spectra.",comprehensive synthesis

"S41  5. 2D-NMR spectra   The 1H and 13C NMR signals reported in the experimental section were assigned with the help of 1H,1H-COSY, 1H,1H-NOESY, 1H,13C-HSQC and 1H,13C-HMBC NMR spectra. The signals of the deuterated TBTQ building blocks  and the deuterated cages (M)-5 and (M)-6 were assigned by comparison with the signals of their literature known non -deuterated congenersS1-S3 and the assignments were confirmed by 2D -NMR spectra (not depicted here ; for the deuterated  cages (M)-5 and (M)-6 no 2D -NMR spectra were measured ).
