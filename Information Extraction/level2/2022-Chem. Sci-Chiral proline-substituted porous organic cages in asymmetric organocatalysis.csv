Geometry Optimized ModelsThe initial structures of CPOC-302-Pro and CPOC-401-Pro were  token from their crystal structures and modified using Materials Studio to add the substituent group. The geometry optimizations were employed  the GFN1-xTB methodS13, S14 with Grimme¡¯s D3 van der Waals  dispersion correction  using the CP2K  codeS15. GFN-xTB is a method of self-consistent, third-order, density functional  tight-binding (DFTB3), suitable  for the calculation of structures,  vibrational frequencies,  and non-covalent interactions in large  molecular systems. Only atomic coordinates of the periodic systems were  optimized, and the cell parameters  were fixed.)  A convergence threshold of 3.0 ¡Á 10?6 Hartree was used for all self-consistent field (SCF)  calculations. The structural optimizations were considered converged if the maximum  force on all atoms  falls below 4.5 ¡Á 10?4 Hartree Bohr?1.",CCDC
"Subsequently to illustrate the generality of the chiral POCcatalysts, we investigated the scope of substrates. The productsthat were obtained catalyzed by CPOC-302-Pro are presented inTable 2. It was found that aromatic aldehydes substituted withvarious electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro, cyano, tri-¬éuoromethyl and pyridine can be employed with cyclohexanoneleading to the corresponding products with excellent yields (90 ¨C99%) and stereoselectivities (80 : 20 ¨C97 : 3 dr values, 87 ¨C92% eevalues). Substituted cyclohexanones and tetrahydropyran-4-onewere also found to be well-tolerated, a ?ording the desiredproducts in high yields with good stereoselectivity. In order toacquire higher enantioselectivity, the reactions of substrates,including cyclopentanone and acetone, with smaller molecularvolume, were studied at 0/C14C. It was observed that cyclo-pentanone could react with p-nitrobenzaldehyde to provide theproduct with good enantio-selectivity (86% ee), while the reac-tion between acetone and p-nitrobenzaldehyde a ?ords onlymoderate enantioselectivity (64% ee). CPOC-401-Pro can alsoe?ciently catalyze this series of reactions, but the a ?ordedTable 1 Asymmetric aldol reactions catalyzed by chiral POCs andrelated catalystsaEntryaCatalyst Time (d) Yieldb(%) anti/synceed(%)1 CPOC-401-Pro 1 98 88 : 12 832 CPOC-302-Pro 2 99 93 : 7 923 BPP 4 96 89 : 11 884L-Proline 10 80 45 : 55 775eCPOC-401-Pro 1 97 88 : 12 /C0836fCPOC-302-Pro 2 98 93 : 7 /C091aReaction conditions: aldehyde (0.20 mmol), ketone (2.0 mmol),10 mol% catalyst (related to the quantity of proline in the material),4-nitrobenzoic acid (4-NBA) (20 mol%), H2O (0.01 mL), and MTBE(1.0 mL).bIsolated yield.cDetermined by1H NMR.dDetermined bychiral HPLC.eCatalyzed by D-proline-substituted CPOC-401-Pro.",comprehensive synthesis

"2.3.1 General Procedure  for asymmetric aldol reactionIn a tube with the aldehyde (0.2 mmol), ketone (2.0 mmol), 4-nitrobenzoic acid (0.04  mmol) and the chiral POCs (10 mol% loading of effective chiral  proline groups) was added 1.0 mL MTBE  and 0.01 mL H2O at room temperature. The mixture was stirred for 3 days at room temperature.  After the reaction was completed (monitored by TLC), 3.0 mL n-hexane  was added to the mixture and the catalyst was isolated by centrifugation and thoroughly washed  with n-hexane for three  times. The combined organic phase was concentrated in vacuo  and puri?ed by column  chromatography on silica gel. 1H NMR spectroscopy was used to determine  the diastereoselectivity  (dr) value. The enantioselectivity (ee) value was determined by HPLC on a chiral-phase Chiralpak AD-H, OD-H or AS-H  column.",comprehensive synthesis

Phys., 2020, 152, 194103Chiral proline-substituted porous organic cages inasymmetric organocatalysis ?Ning Xu,aKongzhao Su,abEl-Sayed M. El-Sayed,abdZhanfeng Juaand Daqiang Yuan *abcThe e ?cient preparation of chiral porous organic cages (POCs) with speci ?c functions is challenging, andtheir application in asymmetric catalysis has not previously been explored. In this work, we have achievedthe construction of chiral POCs based on a supramolecular tetraformyl-resorcin[4]arene sca ?old withdi?erent chiral proline-modi ?ed diamine ligands and utilizing dynamic imine chemistry. Theincorporation of V-shaped or linear chiral diamines a ?ords the [4 + 8] square prism and [6 + 12]octahedral POCs respectively. The appended chiral proline moieties in such POCs make them highlyactive supramolecular nanoreactors for asymmetric aldol reactions, delivering up to 92% ee. The spatialdistribution of chiral catalytic sites in these two types of POCs greatly a ?ects their catalytic activities andenantioselectivities. This work not only lays a foundation for the asymmetric catalytic application of chiralPOCs, but also contributes to our understanding of the catalytic function of biomimetic supramolecularsystems.",this paper's author

"The diamine ligands A3and B3could be regarded as thefunctionalized derivatives of the V-shaped m-phenylenediamineand linear 4,40-diaminobiphenyl. Our previous work showedthat the V-shaped phenylene-diamine linkers give rise to [3 + 6]trimeric triangular prisms, while the linear phenylene-diaminelinkers lead to the formation of [6 + 12] hexameric octahedra.",topology
"Because of the steric hindrance of the proline unit, the existenceof chiral proline moieties in the linkers can not only a ?ect thepore size and environment of POCs, but may also induce theformation of novel self-assembly forms.To explore the in ¬éuence of the chiral proline units on theself-assembly behaviors of calix[4]resorcinarene-based POCs,we¬èrst examined the self-assembly mode of the V-shapeddiamine ligand ( A3). Surprisingly, the reaction betweenC4RACHO and A3in CHCl3produced an unprecedented chiral[4 + 8] tetrameric cage CPOC-401-Pro (Fig. 1). Compared withthe [3 + 6] trimeric triangular prisms, the [4 + 8] tetramericsquare prism that was obtained has a larger window diameter,which undoubtedly weakens the steric hindrance caused by thebulky chiral proline groups. Although the isotopic distributionpatterns of [3 + 6] trimeric cage were detected in reactionsolutions, the crystalline samples of [4 + 8] tetrameric cage ob-tained by di ?usion proved to be the main product. The goodsolubility of CPOC-401-Pro in common organic solvents facili-tates its characterization in solution. Due to the keto-enaminetautomerization of the imine bonds in CPOC-401-Pro, twoenamine-derived proton signals are observed at 9.27 and16.05 ppm in the1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spec-trum (Fig. S3 ?). Meanwhile, the amide proton signals are seen at10.01 ppm, while the proton signals for pyrrolidine units are inthe range of 1.74 ¨C3.82 ppm, suggesting the successful incor-poration of chiral proline units. The structure of CPOC-401-Prowas further con ¬èrmed by 2D1H-1H COSY and1H DOSY tests(Fig. S4 and S5 ?). According to the DOSY spectrum, the di ?u-sion coe ?cient ( D) of CPOC-401-Pro is calculated to be 3.39 /C210/C010m2s/C01and the hydrodynamic radius calculated by theStokes ¨CEinstein equation is 1.13 nm. In the high-resolutionelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF-MS) ofCPOC-401-Pro, the observed ion peak at m/zof 955.6886 corre-sponds to the [M + 5H]5+ion, unambiguously indicating theformation of [4 + 8] tetrameric cage (calculated m/z?955.6889)(Fig. 2a). In addition, the chiral nature of CPOC-401-Pro wascon¬èrmed by its circular dichroism (CD) spectrum.

"Due to the very weak and low-resolution di ?raction data, theaccurate atomic positions of the substituents in CPOC-401-Procannot be located and re ¬èned, but two complete molecularcage units were observed in each asymmetric unit through theelectron-density map. The cage with substituents was modeledin silico and optimized the GFN1-xTB method with Grimme's D3van der Waals dispersion correction using the CP2K code basedon the preliminary crystal data. The results of both the experi-ment and the simulation showed that each cage molecule isconstructed with four C4RACHO as the vertices, and eight A3molecules as the edges, thus forming a tetrameric prismstructure with eight chiral proline groups modi ¬èed on the cageskeleton (Fig. 1). Compared with the [3 + 6] trimeric triangularprisms, the [4 + 8] tetrameric square prisms that were obtainedshould be self-assembly forms with relatively lower energybecause of the bulky chiral proline moieties. This resultsuggests that the presence of substituents may lead to changesin the self-assembly mode of POCs.",topology
