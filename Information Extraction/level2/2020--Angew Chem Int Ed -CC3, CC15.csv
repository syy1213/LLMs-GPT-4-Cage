General synthetic and analytical methods Materials: 1,3,5-Triformylbenzene was purchased from Manchester Organics (UK), (R,R)-cyclohexyl-1,2-diamine was purchased from Fluorochem, and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or TCI UK. Hexachloropropene was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Other solvents were reagent or HPLC grade and purchased from Fisher Scientific. All materials were used as received unless stated otherwise. Synthesis: All reactions were stirred magnetically using Teflon-coated stirrer bars. Where heating was required, the reactions were warmed using a stirrer hotplate with heating blocks, with the stated temperature being measured externally to the reaction flask with an attached probe. Removal of solvents was done using a rotary evaporator. NMR: 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were acquired using an internal deuterium lock for the residual protons in CDCl3 (¦Ä = 7.26 ppm) or CD2Cl2 (¦Ä = 5.32 ppm) at ambient probe temperature on the following instruments: Bruker Avance 400 (400 MHz) or Bruker DRX500 (500 MHz) spectrometers. In order to avoid mixing of porous liquids (PLs) with deuterated solvents or TMS, NMR studies with the PLs were conducted using in-house calibrated CD2Cl2/TMS capillaries so that there was no effect on the PL. Data are presented as follows: chemical shift, integration, peak multiplicity (s = singlet, m = multiplet), and assignment. Chemical shifts are expressed in ppm on a ¦Ä scale relative to ¦ÄTMS (0 ppm) or ¦ÄCDCl3 (7.26 ppm).  13C NMR Spectra were recorded using an internal deuterium lock using CDCl3 (¦Ä = 77.16 ppm) or CD2Cl2 (¦Ä = 54.00 ppm) at ambient probe temperatures on the following instruments: Bruker Avance 400 (101 MHz) or Bruker DRX500 (126 MHz) spectrometers. 129Xe NMR Spectra were recorded using an internal deuterium lock using a sealed capillary of TMS in CD2Cl2 at ambient probe temperature on the following instrument: Bruker DRX500 (138.3 MHz). HRMS: High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was carried out using an Agilent Technologies 6530B accurate-mass QTOF Dual ESI mass spectrometer (capillary voltage 4000 V, fragmentor 225 V) in positive-ion detection mode. The mobile phase was MeOH + 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. PXRD: Laboratory powder X-ray diffraction data were collected in transmission mode on samples held on thin Mylar film in aluminium well plates on a Panalytical X'Pert PRO MPD equipped with a high throughput screening (HTS) XYZ stage, X-ray focusing mirror and PIXcel detector, using Ni-filtered Cu K¦Á radiation. Data were measured over the range 4¨C40¡ã in ~0.013¡ã steps over 60 minutes. Viscosity Measurements: Viscosity measurements were carried out using a calibrated RheoSense ¦ÌVISC viscometer (0.01-100 cP). Measurements were repeated a minimum of three times with the average viscosity reported. Gas Sorption Analysis: Surface areas were measured by nitrogen sorption at 77.3 K. Powder samples were degassed offline at 90 ¡ãC for 15 h under dynamic vacuum (10-5 bar) S3  before analysis, followed by degassing on the analysis port under vacuum, also at 90 ¡ãC. Isotherms were measured using a Micromeritics 2020, or 2420, volumetric adsorption analyzer. Gas uptake measurements for CH4, CO2, and Xe were taken at a temperature of 293 K, stabilized using a circulating water chiller/heater, and N2 were taken at a temperature of 77 K. Gas Uptake and Evolution Studies: All samples of the PL were tested with gases purchased from BOC of the following grades: carbon dioxide (N5.0), methane (N4.5), xenon (N5.0), and nitrogen (N4.8), in GC headspace vials (22 mm x 45 mm screw top, 10 mL, Fisher Scientific). All samples had gas addition and measurements conducted between 20 and 25 ¡ãC in a temperature-controlled laboratory. The flow rate of gas addition was measured using a Gilmont calibrated/correlated flowmeter (tube size 0, Gilmont EW-03201-22) with a stainless steel float on a scale of 1-100, as reported previously.[1] The flow of each gas was calculated from the supplied correlated flow table for air, and general correction equations for approximating gas flow from air using the density of each gas in g/mL at standard conditions taken from the NIST Chemistry WebBook[2] (Gilmont flowmeter calibrated at 1 atm, 294 K), with corrections for temperature and pressure. After optimisation, each gas was maintained at ~50-60 mL/min flow rate by setting the regulator output pressure to 0.5 bar and fine-controlling the flow with a needle valve to the calculated scale readings. Gas evolution was measured by displacement of water in an inverted Rotaflo stopcock 10 mL burette (0.1 mL graduations) in a beaker of water connected to the GC vial containing the sample via a needle/tubing cannula. Measurements were repeated a total of three times at the same temperature to obtain a mean gas evolution and corresponding standard deviation.S4  2.

The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 days. The solution was filtered to remove insoluble precipitate before the DCM was removed by rotary evaporation. The resulting crude cream solid was washed with ethyl acetate (3 ¡Á 150 mL) before being re-dissolved in the minimum amount of DCM (ca. 35 mL), filtered, and recovered by rotary evaporation, to afford a cream solid which was dried in a vacuum oven overnight (5.1 g, 4.9 mmol, 85%).  1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) ¦ÄH (ppm) 8.17¨C7.81 (24H, m, N=CH and ArH), 3.94¨C3.35 (12H, m, CHN=CH), 1.91¨C1.32 (42H, m, CH2 and CH3); 13C NMR (126 MHz, CDCl3) ¦ÄC (ppm) 160.9, 159.2, 155.3, 137.1, 136.6, 129.4, 74.8, 72.3, 61.2, 33.1, 29.5, 24.4, 22.1; HRMS (ES+) calc. for scrambled cages 30136 C60H72N12 960.6003, 31135 C62H74N12 986.6159, 32134 C64H76N12 1012.6316, 33133 C66H78N12 1038.6472, 34132 C68H80N12 1064.6629, 35131 C70H82N12 1090.6785, 36130 C72H84N12 1116.6942; found [M+H]+ 961.5756, 987.6111, 1013.6307, 1039.6470, 1065.6622, 1091.6768, and [M+2H]2+ 481.2969, 494.3127, 507.3215, 520.3295, 533.3370, 546.3443.

A mixture of R,R-CHDA (4.28 g, 37.5 mmol, 6 eq.) and 1,3,5-triacetylbenzene (TAB, 5.10 g, 24.9 mmol, 4 eq.) were dissolved in DCM (50 mL) in a round bottomed flask with 3 ? molecular sieves.

The reverse Dean-Stark apparatus was charged with DCM, and the reaction mixture was heated at 50 ¡ãC with stirring for 3 days. The reaction was allowed to cool to room temperature before being filtered to remove the molecular sieves, and the solvent removed by rotary evaporation to afford the crude product.

"[20]The discretenature of POCs has led to attempts to produce Type1 PLs,[13,21]and to the successful production of Type 2PLs.[1,22]The latter PLs were obtained by dissolving POCs athigh concentration in a solvent that was too bulky to passthrough the windows of the cage. Recently, we investigatedthe uptake, gas selectivity and diffusion of different gases ina PL consisting of a scrambled [4+6] imine POC mixturedissolved in a bulky chlorinated solvent, hexachloropropene(HCP).",topology

The results of these experiments are related to thebinding of CH4in the PLs. The measured diffusion co-efficients for each POC (6.14 /C148 10/C011m2s/C01forCC33:133-R,6.33 /C148 10/C011m2s/C01for CC15 -R) and sample viscosities(Table S6) were used to calculate solvodynamic radii usingthe Stokes-Einstein equation for the two POCs in the PLs(8.2 /C138 for CC33:133-R, 8.3 /C138 for CC15 -R); these values agreewith the expected size of a [4 +6] imine cage.[30]The diffusionco-efficients for CH4in the two PLs (5.43 /C148 10/C010m2s/C01inCC33:133-RPL, 4.58 /C148 10/C010m2s/C01inCC15 -RPL) are signifi-cantly lower than in neat HCP (1.34 /C148 10/C09m2s/C01), indicatingthat association of the gas with the cage is occurring and thatthis is observable by PFG NMR. Since the CH4has notadopted the same diffusion co-efficient as the POCs, thisindicates that the gas is in dynamic equilibrium on the NMRtimescale between the POC cavity and the HCP solvent.",topology
