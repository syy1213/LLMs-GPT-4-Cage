"1In contrast to the irreversibleC每C bond formation, the reversible imination is an attractivealternative synthetic way for obtaining large symmetric macro-cycles and organic molecular cages (OMCs), using relativelysimple building blocks.2,3The choice of suitable buildingblocks is crucial for the rational planning of the synthesis andfor modeling specific properties of the OMCs. For instance,the use of a tripodal aldehyde, 1,3,5-triformylbenzene, andoptically pure vicinal diamines provides a class of chiral mole-cular [4 + 6] cages characterized by an unusual (for pureorganic compounds) Tsymmetry.",topology
"4Extension of the aldehydestructure leads to cages that di ?er in the amine 每aldehyde stoi-chiometry and have substantially larger molecular volumes.5This, however, is at the expense of their stability.6The pres-ence of the OH group in the aldehyde skeleton has a profounde?ect on the structure and properties of the synthesizedOMCs. Recently, Lisowski reported the synthesis of [2 + 3] con-densation products in the reaction of 1,3,5-triformylphloro-glucinol with vicinal diamines.",topology
7The observed [2 + 3] over theexpected [4 + 6] selectivity remains opposed to the previouslypostulated ※odd 每even §rule8and is attributed to the presenceof three OH groups in each aromatic ring.,topology
"The13C CPMAS NMR spectra recorded for cages 5and 7were compared with the13C NMR spectra recorded in CDCl 3for8and 9. All characteristic signals for 5and 7,8and 9appeared in the same spectral regions, regardless of themethod of recording, thereby confirming the postulated struc-tures of the cages (see the ESI ?for details). Owing to the solu-bility in CDCl3we were able to directly compare the13C NMRspectra recorded for the solid and dissolved samples of 6. Bothspectra are in excellent agreement apart from the aromaticregion of the13C and1H NMR spectra of 6. More signals wereobserved than were expected for the D2symmetry, the highestavailable for this particular OMC. Since the [4 + 6] stoichio-metry is not in doubt, the possible reason for the signal multi-plication is the presence of several structures of the samemolecular formula that di ?er in symmetry. Considering thetruncated tetrahedron as a macroscopic representation of themolecular cages 5每7and systematically decreasing its sym-metry by adding the hydroxyl group (one for each triangularside) we obtained 4-combinations with the repetition of threeelements corresponding to fifteen possible isomers that couldbe characterized by trivial C1(isomers 1 每5),C2(isomers 6 每8) orD2(isomer 9, Fig. 2) symmetries.",topology
