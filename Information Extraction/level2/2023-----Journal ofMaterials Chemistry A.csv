"3Moreover, C 2H2is usually produced fromfractionation and oil cracking, which always involve a smallamount of carbon dioxide (CO 2). Therefore, the discriminationof CO 2to a?ord high-purity C 2H2is critical to high-level safetyfor various industrial applications.4Traditional methods toseparate C 2H2/CO 2mixtures, such as solvent extraction andcryogenic distillations, not only su ?er from high energy-consuming and environment-unfriendly problems but alsopossess the risk of introducing secondary by-products. Conse-quently, it is of great importance and urgency to seek bettermaterials for safer storage of C2H2and high-e ?ciency and low-energy technologies to realize C 2H2/CO 2separation.In recent years, adsorption and separation technologiesbased on porous materials have shown promise in addressingC2H2storage and separation problems.5¨C7In this region, porousmetal ¨Corganic frameworks (MOFs) have rapidly developed.8,9For instances, FJI-H8 and SNNU-98 , reported by Hong and Zhaigroups, respectively, have realized gravimetric C 2H2uptakevalues more than 220 cm3g?1under ambient conditions.10,11Furthermore, SNNU-45 , a MOF prepared by the Zhai group, hasdemonstrated the separation of C 2H2/CO 2with breakthroughtime up to 80 min g?1.12In contrast, the development of porousorganic materials (POMs) for C 2H2storage and separation ismarkedly slower than that of MOFs. To the best of our knowl-edge, POMs' C 2H2uptake values are generally less than 100 m2g?1under ambient conditions, and their ability to separateC2H2/CO 2mixtures viaactual breakthrough experiments is alsounderexplored.13Therefore, it is crucial to increase their C 2H2adsorption capacity and explore their C 2H2puri¬ècation abilityto promote the development of POMs in this ¬èeld.",surface area

An examination of theCPOC-107 's solid-state packing suggested that cage moleculespack viaweak van der Waals interactions, and there is alsoa one-dimensional channel in window-to-window mode(Fig. 1e).The presence of 1D channels in CPOC-107 and CPOC-203prompts us to study their porosity. Thermal gravimetric analysismeasurements showed their stabilities up to about 280 ¡ãC(Fig. S7 ?). Before the gas sorption test, both cages are immersedand exchanged 6 times every 24 hours in MeOH before acti-vating at 100 ¡ãC under a high vacuum for 12 hours. Powder X-raydi?raction reveals that a «àer desolvation, no phase changeoccurs in both materials (Fig. S8 and S9 ?). N2gas sorptionexperiments con ¬èrmed their permanent porosity at 77 K(Fig. 2), and both the isotherms of CPOC-107 and CPOC-203exhibited typical type I adsorption behavior with sharpincreases at a pressure below 0.1 P/Po, which reveals theirmicroporous nature.

"ConclusionsIn summary, we presented two novel C4RA-based POCs withhigh nitrogen content (>14%), including [2 + 4] lantern-shapedCPOC-107 and [3 + 6] triangular prism-shaped CPOC-203 . Bothcages exhibit high surface areas (>1100 m2g?1), and high C 2H2uptake capacity (>110 cm3g?1) at 298 K and 1 atm. Notably, thenitrogen content of CPOC-107 is up to 20.1%, and thus its C 2H2uptake capacity under ambient conditions is up to 146 cm3g?1,which is the highest among those reported for POMs. Moreover,CPOC-107 can also e ?ciently separate C2H2/CO 2with a break-through time of 13 min g?1. This work suggests that nitrogen-rich POCs can be promising materials for safer C 2H2storage,as well as C 2H2puri¬ècation application. Further studies arefocusing on design and synthesis of functionalized POCs byintroducing speci ¬èc group sites for improving their gas storageand separation performances.",surface area
"Nitrogen-rich porous organic cages with highacetylene storage and separation performance ?Lijuan Feng,abYifei Xie,aWenjing Wang,aKongzhao Su *acand Daqiang Yuan *acSearching for porous materials that can safely store and e ?ciently separate acetylene (C 2H2), a commonlyused petrochemical feedstock with highly explosive properties, is a pressing and signi ?cant task. Nitrogen-rich porous materials have garnered substantial attention for their ability to interact strongly with acidicC2H2. Herein, we report two novel nitrogen-rich porous organic cages (POCs), namely CPOC-107 andCPOC-203 , constructed from the same bowl-shaped tetraformylcalix[4]resorcinarene but di ?erentnitrogen-rich imidazolium-based diamine synthons. X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals that CPOC-107 adopts a [2 + 4] lantern-shaped structure, whereas CPOC-203 takes on a [3 + 6] triangular prismshape. Moreover, the cages exhibit large cavity volumes of up to 787 ?3and high speci ?c surface areasof up to 1202 m2g?1. Owing to their high surface areas and high nitrogen content, both cages exhibitimpressive C 2H2adsorption capabilities. Speci ?cally, CPOC-107 achieves a remarkable C 2H2uptakevalue of up to 146 cm3g?1at 298 K and 1 atm, the highest among those reported for all porous organicmaterials to date. Moreover, experimental breakthrough tests have con ?rmed the e ?ective separation ofC2H2/CO 2mixtures using the CPOC-107 adsorbent.",this paper's author
