"Considering the multi-window structure and their grid-likeporous assembly structure, the porous properties of 3P-1and3M-1were investigated by nitrogen adsorption and desorptionexperiments. The Brunauer每Emmett每Teller (BET) surface areaswere obtained to be 607 and 605 m2g/C01(Langmuir surface areaare 966 and 977 m2g/C01) and the total volumes were 0.34 and0.34 cm3g/C01for3P-1and 3M-1, respectively. As shown inFig. 3a and b, both cages showed a steep nitrogen uptake atlow relative pressure, which indicates that there are abundantmicropores in the cages. As illustrated by the red Connollysurface (probe radius = 1.82 ?), in the solid state, both 3P-1and3M-1can form connective lattice voids (Fig. 3c and d). As shownin Fig. S19 and S20 (ESI? ), the pore size calculated by theNLDFT method also shows that the pore size distributions ofboth 3P-1and 3M-1are not uniform and confirm the existenceof micropores, but the main pore sizes are close to 1 nm thatare also close to the result of crystal analysis in Fig. 1.",surface area

It was found thatthe chirality of CHDA was transferred and amplified to tetraphenyl-ethylene (TPE) in the process of formation of cages, which furtherendowed the cages with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)characteristics. As a result of the synergy of the chirality and porousstructure in the solid state, both cages exhibited a good chiraladsorption enantioselectivity to a series of aromatic racemates.",this paper's author

"The high-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) gave the molecularion peaks at m/z= 1801.9821 and 1801.9819 for 3P-1and 3M-1,which indicated the formation of [3+6] cages. The Fourier trans-form infrared spectra (FT-IR) displayed that the peak of C QOi nETTBA at 1692 cm/C01disappeared and the peak at 1639 cm/C01ofCQN appeared after imine condensation, which showed that thecages were constructed successfully (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI ?). Inaddition, the cages were characterized by1H,13C,1H每1HC O S Y ,1H每1H NOESY and13C每1H HSQC nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) spectroscopies (Fig. S3每S12, ESI ?), among which1HN M Rand13C NMR further confirmed the structure information of thecages.
