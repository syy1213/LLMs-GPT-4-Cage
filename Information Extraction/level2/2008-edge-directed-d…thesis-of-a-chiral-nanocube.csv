Experimental procedures  General : Reagents and chromatography solvents were purchased from Aldrich and used without further purifi cation except that chloroform was passed through K 2CO 3 prior to use. THF was dried and degased using a Solv Tech solvent purification system. 1H NMR spectra recorded in CDCl 3 and CD 2Cl2 were referenced to residual CHCl 3 and CHDCl 2 at 7.26 and 5.30 ppm. 13C NMR spectra recorded in CDCl 3 were referenced to 13CDCl 3 at 77.0 ppm. Mass spectra were reco rded on an Applied Biosystems Voyager DE-Pro mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF). 2, 4,6-Trihydroxylacetophenone (THAP) was used as matrix. For compounds 6 and 9, Ag(O 2CCF 3) was added to the matrix. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed on a Thermo SpectraSYSTEM HPLC system equipped with dual wavelength  UV/Vis detector (280 nm), Eppendorf CH-30 column heater and two Jordi GPC columns (cross linked DVB; 103 ? pore size; MW cutoff ~ 25,000; 7.8mm ¡Á 30cm) with CH 2Cl2/1% NEt 3 as mobile phase at a flow of 1 mL/min. Approximate molecular weights of  analytes were determined from a semi logarithmic calibration plot (Ln(MW) agai nst retention time) using the following molecular weight standards : benzene (MW 78); cavitand 2 (MW 1075); a NMP hemicarceplex (MW 2348) [1],  and three polyaminonanocaps ules (MW 3941, 5912 and 7882) [2,3].",affiliation
