Experimental detailsGeneral InformationAll reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification. Manipulations were performed under a normal laboratory atmosphere unless otherwise noted. The compounds S1,1 S22 and S33were prepared according to literature. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded at ambient temperature using Bruker AVANCE III 400/500 or Agilent DD2 600 spectrometers, with working frequencies of 400/500/600 and 100/125/150 MHz for 1H and 13C, respectively. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm relative to the residual internal non-deuterated solvent signals (CDCl 3: ¦Ä =7.26 ppm, CDCl 3/CD 3OD: ¦Ä = 3.33 ppm). High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were measured using a SHIMADZU liquid chromatograph mass spectrometry ion trap time of flight (LCMS-IT-TOF) instrument, or a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). PL spectra were recorded on a RF-5301 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) at 298 K. X-ray crystallographic data were collected on a Bruker D8 Venture diffractometer. 42. Synthetic procedures and compound characterizationScheme S1. Synthesis of 1a1a: Compound S1 (200 mg) and compound S2 (184.6 mg) were dissolved in Et 3N (30 mL) under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. Pd(PPh 3)4 (32 mg) and CuI (10.8 mg) were then added and the reaction mixture was stirred at 100 oC for 2d. After cooling to room temperature, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure, yielding crude product. The crude product was further purified by column chromatography (PE/DCM = 1:1, v/v) to give 1a as a light yellow solid (90 mg). 1a was fully characterized by 1H (Figure S1) and 13C NMR spectroscopy (Figure S2) and mass spectrometry (Figure S3), as well as 2D NMR spectroscopy (Figure S4,S5). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl 3) ¦Ä 10.04 (s, 2H), 7.89 (d, J = 8.3 Hz, 4H), 7.74 (d, J = 7.9 Hz, 2H), 7.71 (d, J = 8.2 Hz, 4H), 7.65 (d, J = 1.3 Hz, 2H), 7.57 (dd, J = 7.9, 1.5 Hz, 2H), 1.54 (s, 6H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl 3) ¦Ä 191.4, 154.1, 139.2, 135.4, 132.1, 131.2, 129.6, 126.2, 121.6, 120.5, 94.2, 89.1, 47.0, 26.9.

Specifically, the 1H NMR spectrum (Figure S11) proved the presence of CH¡¤¡¤¡¤? interaction, i.e., see the discussion in the main text.

"1H NMR diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) experiments (Figure S21) demonstrate that 3b has a smaller diffusion coefficient than that of 2b in CDCl 3, indicating that the former compound is composed of more building blocks than the latter one.23Pure tetrahedral cage 3b could be obtained by means of crystallization. Condensing 1b (1.28mg, 4mM) and tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (TREN) (0.291mg, 3.33 mM) in CDCl 3 (0.6 mL), at 0 oC, produced a mixture containing a pill 2b (20%) and a tetrahedron 3b (71%), determined by using ethyl acetate as an internal standard in the NMR sample. Slow evaporation of the solvent at 0 oC yielded a number of crystalline materials, which was re-dissolved in CDCl 3 and its 1H NMR spectrum was recorded, indicating that the crystalline materials correspond to pure 3b. The structure of 3b was supported by both 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy (Figure S22, S23).

"28,29This could be accomplished bysophisticatedly designing the self-assembly precursors orcontrolling the reaction conditions. Therefore, it would be ofimportance to unravel the relationship between the self-assembly preference and the reaction factors, such asgeometries of the building blocks,30solvent,31reactiontemperature,32,33concentration,34usage of guest template,34etc. Herein, we demonstrate ( Figure 1 ) that condensation ofone of the two pseudo-linear bisaldehyde ligands bearing a?uorene group and a trisamino linkage leads to the formationof a mixture of a pill-shaped and a tetrahedral cage, which areself-assembled in the manner of [2 + 3] and [4 + 6],respectively. The self-assembly pathway could be in ?uenced byboth intrinsic and extrinsic reaction e ?ects, including (i) morebulky side chains on the bisaldehydes favor the formation oftetrahedral product; (ii) higher precursor concentration favorsthe tetrahedrons; (iii) higher reaction temperature favors themolecular pills; and (iv) addition of metal cations shifts theequilibrium to the side of the pills almost exclusively.",topology
