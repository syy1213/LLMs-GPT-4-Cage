General Remarks  Commercially available reagents were obtained from Chempur, Fisher Scientific, abcr, Alfa Aesar, Sigma- Aldrich and have been used without further purification unless otherwise mentioned. 5,5',5'' -(ethane- 1,1,1 -triyl)tris(1H -pyrrole -2-carbaldehyde) 1,[S1] (2,4,6 -trimethylbenzene- 1,3,5- triyl)trimethanamine 2-Me,[S2] (2,4,6 -triethylbenzene-1,3,5- triyl)trimethanamine 2-Et[S2] and (2,4,6- tripropoxybenzene- 1,3,5 -triyl)trimethanamine 2-OPr[S3] were  synthesized according to procedures reported in literature. Melti ng points (not corrected) were measured with a B¨¹chi B -540 melting point analyser . NMR spectra were taken on Bruker Avance III 600 (600 MHz) and Bruker Avance III 700 (700 MHz) spectrometers. NMR spectra were internally referenced to residual solvent peaks  in CDCl3 (1H NMR: ¦Ä = 7.26 ppm, 13C NMR: 77.2 ppm). IR -Spectra were recorded on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer on a ZnSe ATR crystal. MALDI -TOF experiments were carried out at a Bruker timsTOFfleX  spectrometer, both with DCTB ( trans -2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl) -2-methyl -2-propenylidene]malononitrile) as matrix. Crystal structure analysis was accomplished on a STOE Stadivari diffractometer with a copper source ( ¦Ë CuK¦Á = 1.54178 ?) and a PILATUS detector. Data processing and absorption correction (X -Area LANA 1.83.8.0)[S4] were accomplished by st andard methods.  Recycling gel permeation chromatography (rGPC) was carried out using a Shimadzu Prominence LC20 system with a  DGU- 20A3R degassing unit, a LC20AD pump unit, a CTO -20AC column oven, Ca BM-20A communication bus module, a SPD-M20A diode array detector,  an FRC-10A fraction collector  and an FCV -20AH2 valve unit  being equipped with a PSS SDV (20 ¡Á 50 mm) pre -column and SDV ( d ¡Á L = 20 ¡Á 300 mm) columns ( 3 ¡Á 100 ? for 3-Et cage ; 2 ¡Á 500 ?  and 2 ¡Á 1000 for cages  3-Me and 3-OPr).",affiliation
