In the crystal structure , CC16 -R is disorder ed over two positions ( Figure S21c) and site occupancies for the disordered parts were determined using a free variable. Single crystals of CC16  were very small and weakly diffracting  (PLAT089_ALERT_3_B ) and synchrotron radiation was therefore required for structure solution. During refinement , a  0.9 ? resolution limit was applied (THETM01_ALERT_3_B ), and a rigid-bond  restraint was used  (RIGU in SHELX). In addition, 1, 2 and 1,  3 bond distance restraints (D FIX and DANG in SHELX), and a planarity restraint  (FLAT in SHELX)  were used during refinement.",CCDC

9. Molecular Simulations  CC18  was studied in its [4+6] and [8+12] molecular masses . Each structure was initially evaluated with high temperature molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in order to explore the potential energy surfaces (PESs) and to identify the lowest ener gy conformers.,topology
"MD simulations were performed with the Macromodel Software (Schr ?dinger PLC) and the recently released OPLS3 force field .[6] The calculations were run at 1000 K for 100 ns with a time step of 1 fs, and each involved the sampling of 10 ,000 structures that were minimi zed at each step of the simulation. The lowest energy conformer was collapsed in both cases (see Figure S24 每 a1 for [4+6] and b1 for [8+12]). H owever , higher energy open conformers were also identified (see Figure S24 每 a2 for [4+6]  and b2 for [8+12]).",topology

"Both open and collapsed conformers for  the [4+6] and [8+12] molecules were re -optimi zed with Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods  in order to rank the structures according to their energy with more accuracy,  and therefore predict the most likely reaction outcome.",topology
"The relative energies  of the conformers were compared, assuming that the conformer with the lowest relative energy is the more likely to form. All of the energies are calculated per [4+6] unit and relative to the energy of the collapsed conformer of [4+6]. Figure S25 shows that the [8+12] size is favoured compared to the [4+6], with the open conformer of [8+12] being 10 kJ mol-1 lower in energy than the collapsed structure of [4+6], therefore explaining the experimental form ation of the [8+12] cage. Furthermore, and in accordance with the experimental results, CC18  is likely to collapse, with the collapsed conformer being  65 kJ mol-1 lower in energy than the equivalent open conformer.",topology

"In order to investigate the structural accuracy of the prediction, the computed open conformer of the [8+12] cage (blue ) was superposed onto the experimentally  available solvate d crystal structure (red). The two structures represent similar octahedral symmetry with a Root Mean Squared Deviation (RMSD) value of 1.52 ? (Figure S26 每 left hand side).",topology
