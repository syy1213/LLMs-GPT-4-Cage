"1每6Although a few examples ofboronic ester cages, or those based on disulphide formation orother DCC reactions are known,7每18,19 每21,22 每26no doubt, thevast majority of shape-persistent organic cages is relying onthe use of multiple imine condensation reactions,1which bearthe advantage to be transformed further to convert these tochemically robust cages,27每31which is for the other type ofDCC reactions di ?cult or even impossible.32Among thoseimine cages, shapes, such as trigonal prisms,33每35tetrahedra,36每39truncated tetrahedra,40,41cubes,42每46tetra-pods,47adamantoids48每50and even more complexstructures51每57have been realized as well as tubular structures,based on linear tetraaldehydes.58每61,62Here we introduce [3 + 6] imine cages based on the conden-sation of triptycene tetraaldehydes with 1,2-cyclohexyl-diamines. Due to the inherent 120～ angle of the triptyceneblades, the resulting imine cage contains concave 羽-wallsgiving the overall structure the shape comparable to those ofcucurbiturils,63每67thus we call the compounds cucurbitimines(Fig. 1).Results and discussionA key-step in the achievement of cucurbitimines is the syn-thesis of a triptycene-based tetraaldehyde precursor, having ontwo aromatic blades two aldehyde units each and at the thirdone none. Therefore, we developed a route where electrondensity of one blade was diminished by turning it into a phe-nazine unit and in addition allowed us to install long solubil-izing hexyl-sidechains (Scheme 1). To achieve this first syn-thetic goal, hexamethoxytriptycene 1was partially oxidized tothe quinone 268每70and condensed with phenylene diamine 371to give phenazine 4in 79% yield.72The next step is the intro-duction of the aldehyde groups. Finally, the tetraaldehyde pre-cursor was achieved by a three-step-method, which was basedon the fourfold chloromethylation to 5(60% yield), followedby basic substitution of chlorine by hydroxyl groups to giveFig. 1 Schematic representation of literature-known tubular [3 + 6]imine cages (left)58每61and the cucurbitimines presented herein.

"With tetraaldehyde 7in hand, condensation reactions with(R,R)-1,2-cyclohexyldiamine 8were investigated under variousconditions (Scheme 2). Solvents, such as MeOH, MeCN, DCM,THF, toluene or CHCl3were used and the reactants withthe addition of a small amount of TFA (2 mol%) were stirred atroom temperature or under reflux. Although in all cases the[3 + 6] cucurbitimine cage was formed, as detected byMALDI-TOF mass spectrometry ( m/z= 2739), the corres-ponding1H NMR spectra revealed that only in DCM the purityof the crude material was high enough to allow isolation andpurification of the cage 9in 10% yield. However, the bestresults were achieved by layering solutions of the two reactantsand let them di ?use into each other, which has been widelyused by Cooper et al.",topology
"37,73,74Although in contrast to their cages,which usually crystallized during formation, here the reactionmixture still kept a clear solution. Nevertheless, by thismethod we were able to isolate cucurbitimine cage ( R,R)-9in49% yield by applying separation with recycling-GPC (gel per-meation chromatography,) besides 5% of the larger [4 + 8]cage ( R,R)-10(m/z= 3653). Using the enantiomeric ( S,S)-1,2-cyclohexyldiamine gave basically the same results and here thecages ( S,S)-9and ( S,S)-10have been isolated in 54% and 5%yield (Fig. 2). It is worth to mention, that the calculated heatsof formation (PM3) for the trimeric cage 9is忖Hf= 751 kJmol?1(250.3 kJ mol per unit) and for tetrameric cage 10忖Hf=975 kJ mol?1(243.3 kJ mol per unit) are very similar, if com-pared per unit ( 忖忖Hf= 7 kJ mol?1). Thus a more equal distri-bution would be excepted, if the cage products are in thermo-dynamically equilibrium. Since it is not the case in combi-nation with all the observations made under various reactionconditions, it is concluded, that the cages 9are rather kineti-cally controlled products than thermodynamically ones.",topology

As in cucurbiturils the height is the same for all members ofthe family, the height is here also the same for cage 10and cage9(9.1 ?). Due to the higher symmetry, the distance between twoopposite oxygens at one rim can be measured. With 9.0 ? it issignificantly larger than e.g.for cucurbituril[8] CB8 (6.9 ?).

The calculated void volume is with368 ?3similar to what we estimated for CB8 with the PDB viewer(351 ?3) but substantially smaller than reported in literature(479 ?3).65Furthermore we calculated the electron density distri-bution, which is similar to curcurbiturils, but less pronounced(see ESI ?), so the curcubitimines may show a similar host 每guestbehaviour as the cucurbiturils.",topology

"ConclusionsBased on a triptycene tetraaldehyde a new type of imine cageshas been introduced that have a similar shape than cucurbi-turils. Therefore, these imine cages are named cucurbitimines.Initial studies demonstrate, that small neutral guests arebound inside the cavity and that their exchange (here THF bytoluene) is kinetically suppressed due to the small windowsizes of the opening. By increasing the temperature, theexchange of guest molecules can be accelerated. This behav-iour is quite similar to that of the cucurbiturils. In contrast tothose, the here discussed cucurbitimines are much bettersoluble in organic solvents and, which for cucubiturils is quiterare,80are chiral, opening up new possibilities for classicalhost Cguest chemistry, but also for separation of volatile chiralcompounds.81Furthermore, we will look for possibilities to getthe larger members of the family ([5 + 10] and higher) to openup new vistas in supramolecular chemistry simply by enlargingthe windows Cas has been done before for cucurbiturils.",topology
