"IntroductionShape-persistent organic cages arefascinating synthetic targets,because their size, geometry, andthepresence offunctionalgroups intheexterior aswellastheinterior oftheir cavities canbeprecisely controlled.[1¨C10]Inaddition totheshape-persistencyandthus thepresence ofanintrinsic pore orcavity, thesemolecular compounds canbeseen asprocessable porous units,ifsoluble enough. This unique combination ofporous cageproperties hasbeen used todecorate surfaces ofquartz crystalmicrobalances,[11,12]making cage-containing membranes,[13,14]coating columns with cages for gas chromatographicpurposes,[15,16]using cage-films forsensing applications,[17]orgenerating porous liquids.[18,19]Nowadays, shape-persistent organic cages aremainlysynthesized byusing reversible condensation reactions, such asbymultiple imine bond formation orthegeneration ofboronicesters from thecorresponding diols andboronic acids.[20¨C60]These reactions used areoften called dynamic covalentchemistry (DCC) reactions, allowing thesystem toreachthermodynamic equilibrium byself-correction mechanisms duetotheintrinsic reversibility.[5,61,62]However, notalways istheformed cage also thefavored product ofthermodynamicequilibrium andtheequilibrium needs tobeshifted byeitherremoving product byprecipitation or,incaseofformed water,byDean-Stark traps orother scavengers (e.g.molecularsieves).[39,42,57,63]Especially when theformed cage isprecipitatingoutofthereaction mixture, itisnotalways clear, ifthecage isathermodynamically orkinetically controlled product.[64,65]Infact,foralarge number ofexperimental protocols, pure cage isgenerated byprecipitation, andithastobequestioned, ifinthese cases thecages arekinetically rather than thermodynami-cally controlled products, especially ifcalculated heat offormations donotfittheexperimental observations.[42,45,46,66]During ourresearch onshape-persistent imine cages,[8]there were afewexamples, where thecages were completelyinsoluble inallcommon solvents, restricting theanalysis toFT-IRspectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis andpore analysis bygassorption.[41,67,68]These were thecubic [414]cage1,which hadhigh specific surface areaof1014 m2/g,highCO2uptake (18.2 wt%) andaverygood Henry selectivity orCO2vsCH4adsorption of40;[41]the[416]exo-functionalized cage2,with similar specific surface area (1037 m2/g)andCO2uptake(14.8 wt%);[67]andthe[416]endo-functionalized cage3,withnoalkyl substituent para tothephenolic OHoftheusedsalicyldialdehyde (Figure 1).[38,68]Although bymonitoring thecage formation bytime-dependent mass spectrometry, polymer oroligomer formationassidereactions were excluded, suggesting thattheproductsarepure cages andthus kinetically controlled products, finalproof ofstructure byNMR spectroscopy oreven single crystalX-ray diffraction waslacking.",surface area

However, mostofthesynthesized imine cages reported areformed asprecipitate from thereaction mixture andtherefore rathermay bekinetically controlled products.

S134  Determination of Yields by Using an Internal Standard  Yields have been calculated from measured 1H NMR spectra of cages 11 ¨C 14 using the following formula   ??=??1????????????????????0??????????? .?100% . (2) ¦Ç is the yield, I1 describes the measured integral of a cage signal in 1H NMR spectrum, I0 is the integral of the same signal, if the cage and the standard would have a 1:1 stoichiometry, nstandard  is the amount of added standard and ntheor. resembles the amount of cage molecules at 100% yield. Uncertainties were calculated applying  propagation of uncertainty  by using the error of weighing.  Since the amount of standard has been calculated by its mas s and the 100% yield amount of cage has been calculated by the amount of added 3,6,15 -triamino -1,8,13 -trihexyloxytriptycene divided by 4 the variables nstandard  and ntheor . can be exchanged using  n = m M-1:  ??=??1?????????????????? 4??????????????0?????????????????? ?????????????100% =400% ???1??????????????0????????????????????????????????????????????????. (3) mstandard  and mamine are the added masses of 1,3,5 -trimethoxybenzen and 3,6,15 -triamino -1,8,13 -trihexyloxy triptycene, respectively, as well as Mstandard  and Mamine are their molecular masses. The error of the yi eld ¦¤¦Ç can be calculated using propagation of uncertainty :  ????=???????????????????????????????????????????? +???????????????????????????????? . (4) Since the errors of the weighing is for both compounds the same value ( ¦¤m = 0.0001 g), equation (4) can be changed to:   ????=????????????????????????????+??????????????????. (5) From equation (5) results equation (6).",topology
