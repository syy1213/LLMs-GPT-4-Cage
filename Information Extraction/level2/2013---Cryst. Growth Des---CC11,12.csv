"In this study, we exemplify such a strategy via two novel [4 +4] macrocyclic imine cages. We show that the use ofcomputation, and in particular automated conformer searches,gives much better structural insight than could be gained fromintuition and chemical knowledge alone.¡ûEXPERIMENTAL SECTIONConformer Searching. Atomistic calculations were performedusing the OPLS all-atom force ?eld,37which was originally para-metrized for organic systems with a focus on conformer energetics,intermolecular energies, and thermodynamic properties. Geometryoptimization was performed using the Polak-Ribiere ConjugateGradient (PRCG) method within MacroModel38and a convergencecriterion of a gradient norm less than 0.05 kJ mol?1??1. Conformersearches were performed using a low-mode39sampling approachwithin MacroModel which follows the low frequency eigenvectors ofthe molecule. We used 10000 search steps with maximum andminimum move distances of 3 and 6 ?. All structures within an energywindow of 50 kJ mol?1of the lowest energy structure were retained,excluding mirror images. We applied a ?nal re ?nement of thestructures and energies by optimizing the resulting molecularstructures with DFT-D3 calculations performed in CP2K40with thePBE functional,41TZVP-MOLOPT basis sets,42GTH-type pseudo-potential,43a plane wave grid cuto ?of 400 Ry, a cubic box of length 50?, and the Grimme-D3 dispersion correction.44This procedure wasapplied to any structure within 20 kJ mol?1of the lowest energyconformer, which we have previously determined to be the maximumerror in the relative energies for the OPLS force ?eld. We have usedthis DFT setup in the past to reliably reproduce the structure andenergetics of porous imine cages in both the solid state16and as singlemolecules and dimer pairs.26We have previously validated theconformer searching approach for other, known molecular iminecages, correctly reproducing molecular conformations as determinedby single crystal X-ray di ?raction structures.28Cage Synthesis.

First, the centre of mass for the molecule was calculated, then the distance between each atom and this centre of mass was calculated. The shortest distance between an atom and the centre of mass was deemed to be the radius of the £¦void£ª that describes the largest sphere that can be accomodated in the centre of the void. The void volume was then calculated as the volume of a sphere based on this radius.  2	 ?

Single crystals of CC12 are very unstable caused by rapid solvent loss once removed from the solution, and furthermore crack within seconds in protective oils commonly used in the preparation of single crystals. Eventually a polyethylene glycol containing oil was found to sufficiently protect the crystals from decomposition. We assume that polyethylene glycols (probably diethylene glycol) replace the original solvent content (dichloromethane, methanol) in the large 1-D solvent accessible channels, thus preventing a collapse of the 3-D structure and single crystals. When the single crystals are removed from the solvent and dried by keeping in air for a few seconds, such £¦desolvated CC12£ª remains polycrystalline, but no crystals suitable for single crystal X-ray diffraction could be obtained. Structure solution of the powder data shows a more compact packing and the loss of the solvent accessible channels. The solvent content, given as 4 diethylene glycol molecules, is an approximation based on the structure refinement. The solvent is heavily disordered, not all atoms were located, and we cannot rule out further contributions of other glycols or the original solvent mix. Despite this, we preferred to give a chemically unsound refinement model of the solvent in this case, rather than to utilize popular methods for removing the solvent contribution to the electron density from the measured data.    12	 ?Variable temperature PXRD of CC12  Variable temperature powder X-ray diffraction data (VT-PXRD) were collected with the multi analysing crystal (MAC) detector on the I11 beamline at Diamond Light Source (Öñ = 0.825556 ?) and using the Cyberstar hot air blower with a ramp rate of 5 K/min.

"7?10Recently, a number ofthree-dimensional organic cages have been synthesized, whichcan be either nonporous11?13or permanently porous.14?17Organic cage catenanes18have also been prepared using DCCroutes that can form up to 32 imine bonds in a singlereaction.19Some of these organic cages can exhibit surprisinglyhigh surface areas in the solid state,16,20in one case greater than2000 m2g?1,21thus rivaling porous extended frameworks.

All of the imine cagemolecules reported so far by our group have been prepared bythe cycloimidation reaction of trialdehydes with aliphaticdiamines; that is, the underlying aldehyde-to-amine reactionstoichiometry is 2:3. This has allowed the synthesis of [2 +3],28,49[4 + 6],14,16,28,50and [8 + 12] cages.15Self-assemblyreactions with 2:3 stoichiometry are also common for metal ?organic cages.4Di?erent geometrical shapes and topologies canbe accessed by exploring di ?erent reaction stoichiometries, andhere, we explored the synthesis of two new cagelike molecules,CC11 andCC12 , via the cycloimidation reaction of a triaminewith two homologous trialdehydes (Scheme 2), that is, anoverall stoichiometry of 1:1, assuming complete iminecondensation. A tripodal amine, tris(2-aminoethyl)amine(TREN), was used which was previously reported to formsmall [2 + 3] molecular cages when reacted with dialdehydes.51There are many potential [ n+n] combinations that wouldsatisfy a 1:1 stoichiometry, not including the possibility ofcross-linked polyimine formation. However, trial reactions and,in particular, mass spectrometry and1H NMR measurements(Figures S3, S4, S6, and S7 of the Supporting Information)suggested the major product in both of these cycloiminationreactions was a [4 + 4] cage52(observed molar masses forCC11 andCC12 = 1686 and 2599 g mol?1). Given the size,complexity, and probable conformational ?exibility of thesemolecules, it is hard to make intuitive predictions as to theirmost likely 3D structures, although the approximately trigonaltriarylamine node would seem to preclude the idealized ¡ùcube ¡ìstructure to which these [4 + 4] cages are topologicallyequivalent (Scheme 3).",topology
"Structural models for the two new imine cages, CC11 andCC12 , were constructed manually, assuming an underlying [4 +4] topology as shown in Scheme 3. Immediately upongeometry optimization, the conformation of both moleculesbecame tetrapodal in nature, with the tertiary amine nitrogensof the TREN linker forming the four apexes of the macrocyclic¡ùtetrapods ¡ì. This suggests, in the gas phase at least, where nosolvent is included, that no energetic barriers exist to preventthe ¡ùcollapse ¡ìof the in ?ated cage. To explore whether therewere alternative conformations, perhaps possessing an internalvoid, we then performed extensive conformer searching to ?ndlow energy conformers for each of the two molecules.",topology
"The results from the OPLS energy-ranked conformer searchshowed that all low energy conformations of these cagestructures were broadly tetrapodal in nature, as shown in Figure1 by an overlay of all conformations found within 50 kJ mol?1of the global minimum (147 conformations for CC11 and 266conformations for CC12 , excluding mirror images). Thedi?erences between these conformations involve smallrotations about the phenyl rings on the tetrapod ¡ùarms ¡ìandrotations about the C arene?Carene?Cimine?Nimine bond. TheseScheme 3.

In keeping with this,CC12 exhibits disorder in the rotation of the phenyl rings inthe single crystal structure of its solvate.",topology
"Crystal Structure Determination. Initially, all attempts atisolating crystalline forms of CC11 failed, whether this wasdone by slow evaporation, by slow precipitation, or by carefulsolvent exchange. In all cases, the material underwent a rapidcolor change upon removal from the mother liquor and becameirreversibly insoluble, suggesting that the material rapidlypolymerizes upon spontaneous desolvation. We eventuallysucceeded in growing single crystals of the [4 + 4] adductsdirectly by carrying out the reactions in pure methanol, butthese crystals were also found to degrade rapidly upon removalfrom the reaction solvent. The colorless crystals were ?nallystabilized by encapsulating them in per ?uoropolyether oil priorto removal from the reaction solvent, and we obtained singlecrystal X-ray data at 100 K for the solvate of CC11 (Figure 2,left).",topology
"13,17,20Theencapsulated crystals degraded within the protective oil coatingupon desolvation at ambient temperature. The cage moleculesare broadly tetrapodal in shape, in agreement with theconformer predictions, with the TREN moiety forming thecap at the end of each of the arms of the tetrapod. To ourknowledge, this is the ?rst example of a [4 + 4] reactionbetween a trialdehyde and a triamine and the ?rst example of amacrocyclic organic ¡ùtetrapod ¡ì.",topology
"In contrast to CC11 , we were able to crystallize CC12 byslightly altering the ratio of the dichloromethane to methanol inthe reaction mixture. Single crystals of CC12 were unstable todesolvation and were observed to transform to a ?ne but stillpolycrystalline yellow powder when removed from the reactionmixture. No crystals of air-dried CC12 could be isolated thatwere suitable for single crystal X-ray di ?raction. Uniquely, apolyethylene glycol (PEG) oil was found, unlike all the otherprotective ?uids investigated, to protect the CC12 crystals fromdecomposition. The [4 + 4] cages were again found to betetrapodal in shape, with each of the four arms capped by theTREN moiety. The unit cell was identi ?ed as monoclinic withspace group P2/n. We believe that the PEG oil, and possiblythe diethylene glycol component in that oil, replaces theoriginal reaction solvents (dichloromethane and methanol) inthe large, one-dimensional (1D) solvent-accessible channels inthe crystals (Figure 3), thus preventing degradation of thestructure. For example, the PEG-containing crystal was slowly(over several hours) heated to 350 K; at about 275 K, it beganto show some signs of decomposition, but no furtherdeterioration was observed afterward. The crystal was thenleft at 350 K for approximately one hour, after which it wascooled to 100 K to obtain a data set of the partially desolvatedmaterial. This revealed that the dichloromethane moleculeswere removed from the original structure, while the channelcontent, the PEG oil, still remained.",topology
Nonencapsulated crystals of CC12 that were removed fromthe reaction solvent and exposed to air for a few seconds rapidlycracked but were found by powder X-ray di ?raction (PXRD) toremain polycrystalline. Variable temperature PXRD of the air-dried microcrystalline powder held in an unsealed glasscapillary was used to monitor the change in di ?raction uponFigure 1.

"We next examined whether alternative shapes, such as adistorted cube, might be found to lie higher in energy and,hence, be accessible by templating, using an appropriate solventor template. To do this, the conformer search was repeatedwith larger maximum moves allowed (up to 20 ?), and allstructures (26233 in total) lying within 1000 kJ mol?1of theglobal minimum were retained. Automated analysis of the sizeof the internal void for these structures showed that allstructures in this large energy window maintain a ¡ùcollapsed ¡ìtetrapodal conformation, with a very small internal void (up to7?3) compared to the much larger void (>2000 ?3) that wouldbe expected for an expanded, shape-persistent [4 + 4] ¡ùporous ¡ìcage. As such, these simulations would suggest, a priori, that (i)this [4 + 4] combination is strongly predisposed to form atetrapodal cage, irrespective of solvent, and (ii) thiscombination of building blocks has little promise for theconstruction of shape-persistent cages with large, internalcavities.",topology
"¡ûDISCUSSIONThis study shows that systematic conformer searching canaccurately predict the low-energy 3D structures of large organiccages that have signi ?cant conformational ?exibility. We believethat these calculations are useful in a predictive sense becausethe time required for the conformer searches (<24 h on a singlecore) is signi ?cantly shorter than the laboratory time requiredfor preparation, crystallization, and structure solution formolecules of this type. For example, these particular [4 + 4]combinations are revealed by computation to be poor choicesfor the generation of shape-persistent cages with permanentinternal voids. Clearly, the methods could also be used in thereverse sense to identify combinations of building blocks thatlead to cage structures where a stable, shape-persistent voidrepresents the conformational energy minimum. We thereforesee this method as a useful component in a broader strategy forthein silico design of functional organic solids, as outlined inScheme 1.",topology
"15However, given that our primary interest is in porousorganic crystals, a methodology that predicts the lowest energydesolvated form is of broad utility. Indeed, the type of ¡ùvirtualporosity ¡ìreferred to by Barbour,54which results from deletingguests from a crystal structure, is of less practical interest andwill not be predicted using these gas phase calculations. It isalso known that some macrocyclic cages can form catenanesunder certain conditions, and this methodology would notpredict such structures without signi ?cant extension; indeed,the automated construction of, for example, models for triplyinterpenetrating catenanes18is a signi ?cantly more challengingprospect than the construction of models for discrete,noncatenated cages, where s tarting structures could beapproximated, in the ?rst instance, to Platonic andArchimedean solids.55It is also important to stress that intrinsic porosity in a single,isolated molecule does not ensure porosity in the solid state: forexample, CC1 is intrinsically porous but its most stablepolymorph packs in such a way that these intrinsic voids aredisconnected.14In principle, this too can be addressed viacrystal structure prediction methods, as we already demon-strated for smaller [4 + 6] cages.16¡ûCONCLUSIONSWe have synthesized two new [4 + 4] imine cages with uniquemacrocyclic ¡ùtetrapod ¡ìstructures. These cages have little or nointrinsic void volume in the solid state, and this can bepredicted de novo by systematic conformer searches that revealno low-energy structures with a permanent pore. That is,calculations tell us, with good con ?dence, that there is noprospect with these building blocks of forming anything like the¡ùporous organic cube ¡ìillustrated in Scheme 3. There isexcellent agreement between the lowest energy predictedstructures and experiment for both [4 + 4] tetrapods, as well asfor a range of [4 + 6] imine cages that we synthesized inprevious studies. Coupled with algorithms that automate theinitial structure generation, this methodology will form a basisin the future for screening large numbers of hypotheticalorganic cages with respect to their potential for intrinsicporosity. Importantly, we believe that computation here ismuch more powerful than simple ¡ùintuition ¡ì; in this case, itgives an unambiguous prediction that nonporous tetrapods willbe formed, and that no other conformers are thermodynami-cally competitive. Indeed, the lowest-energy predictedstructures (Figure 7) are remarkably close to thosecharacterized by single crystal X-ray di ?raction. By contrast,chemical intuition alone suggested that an idealized cube(Scheme 3) was unlikely, but it told us little more than that,and these macrocyclic tetrapods were a synthetic surprise. Infact, automated conformer searching readily anticipates theformation of these structures based solely on knowledge of thestructural formula for the molecule.",topology
"(52) A [2 + 2] catenane would also give the same molar masses;however, the relatively simple1H NMR suggested a noncatenatedproduct.",topology
"The approach also has some inherent limitations: forexample, the calculations are performed in the gas phase andwill not therefore take account of crystal-packing forces,although this could be incorporated in a subsequent crystalstructure prediction step for molecules that provoke prelimi-nary interest. Likewise, while tetrapods CC11 andCC12 donot exhibit ¡°solvent-in ?ated ¡±structures, it is likely that othermolecules will crystallize as solvates with molecular structuresthat are quite di ?erent from the low-energy, desolvated forms:indeed, we have already observed this for a large [8 + 12] iminecage.",topology
