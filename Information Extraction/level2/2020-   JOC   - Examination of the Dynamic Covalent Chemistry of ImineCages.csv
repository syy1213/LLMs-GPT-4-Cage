It is generally assumed that the imine bond is ratherchemically labile allowing a sel f-correction mechanism untilthermodynamic equilibrium is reached, which is often the case ifa cage is formed. However, there are some contradictoryexperimental data to this assumption. To get a deeper insight intothe imine bond dynamics of covalent organic cages, we studied theformation and exchange of both dialdehydes and triamines of twodi?erent [2 + 3] imine cages with the aid of a deuterated dialdehydemolecular building block.",topology
"9Based on experimental data on cage stabilities andformation, possible exchange of molecular building blocks waselaborated and later on studied in more detail:10a thermody-namic, less stable cage was transferred to a more stable one byadding either another triamine or dialdehyde. A similarobservation was made by the Li group.11Cram and Stoddartsuggested an imine exchange of a carcerand by an acid-catalyzedbar-opening/bar-closing mechanism by exchanging diamineunits.12Very recently, Ko ?odziejski et al. presented a verydetailed study of the self-sorting and exchange of aldehydeprecursor units of TREN-based cages.13We and otherresearchers studied chiral self-sorting, which also relies on adynamic interconversion of imine bonds.4g,14Most convincingexperiments to demonstrate the dynamics of the imine bondformation were done by the Li group by investigating theinterconversion of a pillared [2 + 3] cage into a tetrahedral [4 +4] cage under di ?erent conditions. Depending on temperatureor concentration, a clear shift toward one of these two cages wasobserved.",topology

For instance, theformation of a cubic [4 + 4] salicylimine cage was monitoredby time with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of?ight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS).",topology
"driven by precipitation, similar to that for most salicyliminecages described previously.4e,g,16One clear example of akinetically controlled product is the formation of truncatedtetrahedral [4 + 4] imine cages that have been made inacetonitrile.",topology
"17As soon as tri ?uoroacetic acid is added, the cagesdecompose to give an insoluble polymeric material, whichturned out to be a crystalline covalent-organic framework.17Asmentioned above, computational screening of large combinato-rial libraries of possible cages relies on the assumption that theseare thermodynamically favored, and exactly these truncated [4 +4] cages were predicted not to form.",topology
"6bBesides the ¡ùlost hit ¡ìofthe truncated tetrahedral [4 + 4] cages, there are a few moreexamples, where such calculations were not able to explain theexperimentally found preferred product. In this respect, Cooperand co-workers observed the cage enlargement of a [4 + 6] to an[8 + 12] imine cage, despite the theoretical calculated preferencefor the smaller one.",topology
"6cThe same group observed the formation ofopen-pot cages preferably to a social self-sorted mixture of [4 +6] and [4 + 4] imine cages despite the calculatedthermodynamic favor toward the mixture.7Because of all these ¡ùcontradictory ¡ì?ndings, we wereinterested in investigating the dynamics of the imine bonds oforganic cages in more detail, once these have formed. To excludeany driving forces by electronic di ?erences of the used amines oraldehydes or di ?erent solubility of either reactants, intermedi-ates, or cages, we decided to look at scrambling of [2 + 3] iminecages and their deuterated congeners under di ?erent conditions,which we describe herein.",topology
"The incorporation of the deuterated tert-butyl groups ( tBu-d9) into cage 4-d27 was unambiguously proven by missing thesignal of the tert-butyl protons at Ñ´= 1.37 ppm in the1H NMRspectrum, which was previously observed for cage 4(seeFigure1). Similar observation was made for the pair 5and5-d27 (herethetert-butyl protons resonate at 1.39 ppm). More important forour studies is the clear di ?erentiation by MALDI-TOF MS.

"Solvent E ?ect on Cage Formation. As mentioned above,several conditions (di ?erent solvents, presence or absence ofcatalytic amounts of acid) have been reported for the synthesisof cages. For [2 + 3] imine cages of the general structure of 4,typically EtOH, MeOH, CH2Cl2, CHCl3, or acetonitrile arereported.18a,b,d,e,19a,cSince we found for [4 + 4] cages that theseare formed exclusively in acetonitrile without acid, a solventscreening (with and without acid) was done for the cagesynthesis of 4and5to study its in ?uence (see Schemes 2 and3andTables 1 and2for NMR analytics, see the SupportingInformation , Figures S46 ?S49). It is worth mentioning thatalthough all reactions were performed at least twice, we were notinterested in determination of exact yields, but in estimating thenumber of formed cages in solution and in the solid state of aformed precipitate. If a precipitate was formed, it was collectedby?ltration, dried, wei ghed, and analyzed by1HN M Rspectroscopy. The remaining mother liquor was dried, a de ?nedamount of 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene added as internal standard,and investigated by1H NMR spectroscopy to estimate theamount of formed cages by integration of a characteristic protonsignal ( 4:Ñ´= 7.18 ppm, 5:Ñ´= 7.59 ppm) and 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene ( Ñ´= 7.09 ppm).",topology
"No scrambling was observed in EtOH or MeOH êôsolventsmost often used to synthesize these [2 + 3]-cages. Again, cage 5is di?erent. No scrambling was observed with aldehyde 1-d9,when no acid is present, but scrambling is detected in toluene,MeCN, MeOH, and EtOH with acid. Cage 5is thermodynami-cally favored over cage 4byââGeq=?6 kJ/mol. Nevertheless,cage 4was not converted to cage 5upon the addition of TRENwhen the reaction mixture was kept in the solid state êôoncemore emphasizing how important the solvent and solubility ofcages and intermediates therein are, to allow the system to reachthermodynamic equilibrium.",topology
"To demonstrate the role of kinetics in imine cage chemistry,we were able to convert thermodynamically more stable cage 5to cage 4nearly quantitatively based on the knowledgegenerated herein.

Org. Chem. 2020, 85, 13757 ?1377113764¡ûCONCLUSIONSThis study emphasizes how important the role of solvent forimine cage formation is and that once the cage has formed,under most conditions it does not undergo a dynamic exchangewith an aldehyde of the same solubility and reactivity as the onealready used for the cage-forming reaction. This does notnecessarily mean that it is (but it can be!) the kinetic product,especially when it precipitates out of the reaction mixture as hasalready been stated by De Rycke et al. earlier: ¡ùThe literatureemphasizes the thermodynamic stability of such assemblies[cages] but in precipitation processes one might consider thereaction to be kinetically controlled. ¡ì18bThis may explain whycomputational screening of thermodynamic data (such as heator energy of formation) of ?nal compounds exclusively can leadto contradictory experimental observations, such as has beenreported in the case of the formation of a (thermodynamicallyunfavored) cage pot7or a (thermodynamically unfavored) larger¡ùdoubled ¡ìcage.6cAlthough by high throughput screening ofthermodynamic heat of formations of cages, a large number ofinteresting new cage structures were found to form, but purelyrelying on these calculations can lead to the missing of veryinteresting structures, such as the tetrahedral [4 + 4] imine cagesfrom our group,17which have successfully been synthesized andstudied further.18c,20As Jelfs and co-workers recently pointedout,7computations of kinetic pathways of cage formations aremuch more complicated and time-consuming than those forcalculating relative energies of formation but may need to beconsidered in cases where theoretical and experimental data donot give the same picture.Scheme 8.
