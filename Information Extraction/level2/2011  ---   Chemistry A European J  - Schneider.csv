"[8]Up to date, there are only a few permanentporous systems derived from discrete molecules. One of thefirst permanent porous crystalline systems of defined organ-ic compounds was tris( o-phenylenedioxy)cyclotriphospha-zene (TPP), described already in 1964 by Allcock and co-workers:[9]This system was reinvestigated recently by Sozza-ni et al.,[10]and later by several other groups.[11]Their studiesshowed that the enclathrated solvent molecules can be re-Abstract: The synthesis of various pe-riphery-substituted shape-persistentcage compounds by twelve-fold con-densation reactions of four triptycenetriamines and six salicyldialdehydes isdescribed, where the substituents sys-tematically vary in bulkiness. The re-sulting cage compounds were studiedas permanent porous material by nitro-gen sorption measurements. When thematerial is amorphous, the stericdemand of the cages exterior does notstrongly influence the gas uptake, re-sulting in BET surface areas of approx-imately 700 m2g/C01for all cage com-pounds 3c每e, independently of the sub-stituents bulkiness.

Furthermore, wefound that two different crystallinepolymorphs of the cage compound 3a(with tert-butyl substituents) differ alsoin nitrogen sorption, resulting in aBET surface area of 1377 m2g/C01, whensynthesized from THF and 2071 m2g/C01,when recrystallized from DMSO.Keywords: cage compounds ﹞gassorption ﹞porosity ﹞salicyldialde-hydes ﹞Schiff base[a] Dipl.-Chem.

"Results and DiscussionSynthesis of cage compounds : The [4 +6] cage compounds3a每eof this series were synthesized by a twelve-fold con-densation reaction of salicyldialdehydes 2a每eand triamine 1(Scheme 2). Salicyldialdehyde 2bwas synthesized by amethod by Feringa et al.,[29]and salicyldialdehydes 2c每ewere synthesized by a two-fold Duff formylation of the cor-responding 4-substituted phenols ( 4c每e)[30]with hexameth-ACHTUNGTRENNUNGylenetetramine (HMTA) and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), ac-cording to a procedure of Svenstrup et al. (Scheme 3).[31]Be-sides the desired salicyldialdehydes 2c每e, substantialamounts of the corresponding monosalicylaldehydes 5a每e[32]were obtained, which were separated by column chromatog-raphy. In contrast to the synthesis of cage compound 3art,b yusing triamine 1with the commercial available salicyldialde-hyde 2a,[25]it turned out that for the synthesis of cage com-pounds 3a每ewith the salicylaldehydes 2a每e, synthesized inour laboratory, a catalytic amount (2 mol%) of trifluoroace-tic acid accelerates the reaction. By the addition of 2 mol%TFA, cage compound 3artwas synthesized in 60% yieldfrom salicylaldehyde 2awith 1, precipitating as orange solidfrom THF at room temperature.[25]In the reaction of salicyl-dialdehyde 2bwith 1, we were not able to separate the cor-responding cage compound 3bfrom reaction intermediates,although the formation of the desired product can be detect-ed by a basis peak at m/z1882 in the MALDI-TOF MS ofthe crude product (see Figure S14 in the Supporting Infor-mation), suggesting that precipitated reaction intermediatesare already very insoluble. Even at reflux temperature andhigh dilution, the reaction did not run to completion. Ac-cordingly, under the same conditions, 2cand1were reactedto cage compound 3crt, which precipitates from the reactionmedium and was isolated in 71% yield. For the reactions ofsalicyldialdehyde 2dand 2e, with bulkier substituents, wedeveloped another method, because the products ( 3dandScheme 2.

"[16]They identified 3,3 ＊,4,4＊-tetra(trime-thylsilylethynyl)biphenyl (TTEB) as a potential porous ma-terial and investigated the compounds gas-sorption proper-ties. Indeed, TTEB has a Brunauer每Emmett每Teller (BET)surface area of 278 m2g/C01and adsorbs 0.8 wt% of hydrogengas at 77 K and 10 bar.[16]Another type of porosity, intrinsicporosity, is observed for compounds which contain definedcavities or voids in the molecules themselves, such as in cu-curbiturils and calixarenes. Investigations showed that intheir crystalline states accessible pores exist for gas adsorp-tion.",surface area
"[17]Via dynamic formation of covalent bonds, shape-per-sistent organic cage molecules[18]are accessible in reasonableyields from readily available precursors. It was discoveredrecently, that some of them are permanent porous with highsurface areas of up to 1377 m2g/C01and selective gas-sorptionproperties. One example is the so-called Noria from Nishi-kubo et al.,[19]which was reinvestigated by Atwood and co-workers.[20]Unlike the above-mentioned materials, this com-pound does have not to be crystalline to adsorb reasonableamounts of gases: The amorphous material has a BET sur-face area of 350 m2g/C01, a pore volume of 0.13 cm3g/C01and se-lectively takes up CO2(2.5 mmolg/C01at 30 bar and 298 K)preferably to N2. Cooper et al. examined shape-persistent[4+6] cage molecules, which are accessible by Schiff basecondensation of four diamine molecules and three moleculesof 1,3,5-triformyl benzene.",surface area
"[21,6]Depending on the peripher-ies, the cage molecules assembled differently in the solidstate, having certain pore shapes and sizes. These cage mole-cules showed BET surface areas of up to 1333 m2g/C01andgas selectivities for CO2over methane.[6]Additionally, thepores could be switched ※on每off§ by crystallizing the com-pounds from different solvents.",surface area
"[22]In a similar fashion,Zhang et al. reported the synthesis of [2 +3] cage com-pounds, which selectively adsorbed CO2(up to 0.84 wt%)over N2.[23a,b]This is also the case for a [2 +3] propeller cagecompound described by Cooper et al., absorbing CO2(3.96wt% at 1.2 bar and 300 K) selectively over N2.[23c]Very re-cently, we described the synthesis of an adamantoid endo -functionalized [4 +6] cage compound 3aby a one-pot iminecondensation reaction of triptycene triamine 1[24]and thecommercially available salicyldialdehyde 2a(Scheme 1).[25]The compound showed an extraordinary high surface areaof 1377 m2g/C01, measured by nitrogen sorption at 77.35 K.[26]This is to the best of our knowledge the highest valueamong porous materials, consisting of discrete molecules, in-cluding metal-organic polyhedra (MOPs).",surface area

"[26]Thecages themselves self-assemble via p每pinteraction of the ar-omatic subunits. In contrast to the crystal structure of thetert-butyl substituted cage compound 3a,[26]four differenttypes of relative arrangements of the phenolic subunits canbe distinguished (see Figures S82每S87 in the Supporting In-formation). The cages form large 3D porous networks,which are filled with THF molecules. These THF moleculescan be used as probe to image the three-dimensional pore-structure (see Figure 5).Gas-sorption and pore-size analysis : Recently, we reportedfor the material of cage compound 3arta BET surface areaof 1377 m2g/C01, a Langmuir surface area of 1566 m2g/C01and amicropore volume of 0.42 cm3g/C01.[26]Cage compounds 3a每3e, synthesized by various conditions, were analyzed by ad-sorption of nitrogen gas to determine the BET surface areasand pore size distributions. The objective of the investiga-tions is to gain insight to which degree the molecular struc-ture of the cage molecules influences the formation of gasaccessible pores in the corresponding material. Before gas-sorption measurements, the stabilities of the compoundswere investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Allas-synthesized and dried cage compounds 3a每eshowed noweight loss up to 4008C (see Figure S35). The crystalline,air-dried samples show a sharp step upon heating to 200 8C,which corresponds to the removal of enclathrated solventmolecules from the pores. All samples were treated at2008C and 6/C14810/C02mbar for 24 h before nitrogen sorptionexperiments were performed at 77.35 K. For the as-synthe-sized cage compounds 3c每ethe nitrogen-sorption isothermsFigure 5. Channel system of crystalline 3c.

"[37]The isotherms show only small hyster-eses which indicate that during gas adsorption/desorptiononly minor rearrangements of the cage scaffolds or thecages themselves in the packing take place. In contrast tothe BET surface area of 1377 m2g/C01reported for cage com-pound 3a,[26]the BET surface area values for all as-synthe-sized cage compounds 3c每eare in the range between 690and 727 m2g/C01(see Table 2, entries 4, 5, 7 and 9), independ-ently whether the substituents in the periphery are less(methyl) or more bulky (triethylmethyl, trityl). Furthermore,the ratios of micropore volumes to the overall pore volumesis between 66 and 76% (calculated by the tplot method)[38]of the total surface area and are all in the same range be-tween Vmicro=0.19 cm3g/C01and 0.23 cm3g/C01andVtotal=0.37 to0.34 cm3g/C01. Although BET surface areas and pore volumesof as-synthesized 3c每eare very similar, the pore size distri-butions derived by NL-DFT methods gave different results.The NL-DFT derived pore size distribution of 3crtis similarto that of 3artwith two maxima pore width at 5 and 11 /C138. Ifthe compound is synthesized at reflux temperature ( 3cD), anadditional maximum at 9 /C138 can be detected, which is alsothe absolute maximum. The material of as-synthesized 3dshows two maxima at 4 and 15 /C138. The NL-DFT pore sizedistribution of as-synthesized material of 3eshows twomaxima at pore width with 7.5 and 12 /C138. In contrast to theamorphous material of the cage compounds, the gas-sorp-tion properties of crystallinematerials is very different (seeFigure 6, top). The crystallinematerial of 3ccrshows analmost ideal type-I isotherm,which is reflected in a high mi-cropore area contribution onthe total surface area (93%)and a pore volume of Vmicro=0.48 cm3g/C01. The BET surfacearea is with 1291 m2g/C01compa-rable to that of 3art, which wasalso synthesized from THF andis crystalline.",surface area
"[26]Microporeanalysis by NL-DFT methodsrevealed three maxima of porewidth at 4, 6 and 8 /C138, withvery narrow pore-size distribu-tions. The crystalline materials3dcrand3ecr, with more bulkysubstituents in the cage periph-ery, resulted in BET surfaceareas of 309 and 22 m2g/C01. Thisis much lower than the surfaceareas of the amorphous materi-al (see Table 2, entries 8 and10). A reasonable explanationfor this is a tighter packing ofthe molecules in the crystallinestate, resulting in a blocking of the pore windows for theaccess of gases. Unfortunately, no high quality single-crystalsfor an X-ray crystal structure analysis to verify this hypothe-sis were obtained to date. For 3dcr, four major maxima canbe calculated at pore width of 7, 14, 18 and 28 /C138. Basically,for3ecrno maxima for pores can be detected by NL-DFTmethods, because of the lack of porosity. It was mentionedbefore, that the as-synthesized material of 3afrom THF ismicrocrystalline but shows a different powder X-ray diffrac-tion (PXRD) pattern than the crystals grown from DMSO,for which we were able to elucidate the structure by gettinga sufficient dataset by X-ray diffraction of a single crystal.",surface area
"[26]This suggests that those two crystalline materials are twodifferent polymorphs.[26]Compound 3awas crystallized fromhot DMSO, giving a sufficient amount of crystalline material3acr(b)for reliable gas-sorption experiments after removal ofenclathrated solvent molecules in vacuum. In comparison tothe microcrystalline as-synthesized material of 3artthe mate-rial of 3acr(b)shows an increasing nitrogen uptake and hencea higher BET surface area of 2071 m2g/C01and a Langmuirsurface area of 2327 m2g/C01. The micropore volume was cal-culated to be Vmicro=0.77 cm3g/C01, which is 91% of the totalmeasured pore volume of Vtotal=0.86 cm3g/C01. Contrary, theas-synthesized material of tert-butyl cage compound 3aDsynthesized under reflux conditions show a lower nitrogenuptake than 3art(see Table 2, entry 2), having a BET surfacearea of 950 m2g/C01.

"ConclusionTo summarize, we successfully synthesized a series of pe-riphery substituted endo -functionalized adamantoid cagecompounds. The substituents are in nature of various stericdemands. We demonstrated that all cage compounds exhibitpermanent porosities with high surface areas and narrowpore-size distributions. The correlations between the molec-ular structures and porosities of the materials were exam-ined in dependence of the peripheral moieties of the cagecompounds. The influence of the bulkiness of the peripheralgroups can be neglected, when the investigated materialsare amorphous: Except 3a, all as-synthesized cage com-pounds ( 3c每e) are amorphous and have very similar BETsurface areas of 700 m2g/C01(3c), 727 m2g/C01(3d) and690 m2g/C01(3d), suggesting that the cavity size of the cagecompounds predominantly dictates the gas-sorption proper-ties of the amorphous material. In their crystalline states,the bulkiness of the peripheral moieties plays a crucial roleon the accessible surface area. For cage compound 3c, withmethyl groups in the periphery, the BET surface area is with1291 m2g/C01almost doubled in comparison to the surfacearea of the amorphous material (729 m2g/C01). With moietiesthat are sterically more demanding, the accessible surfacearea for nitrogen gas at 77.35 K drops from approximately729 to 309 m2g/C01for3d(with 3-ethylpentyl groups) or evenfrom 690 to 22 m2g/C01for3e(with trityl groups). Further-more, various crystalline polymorphs of compound 3adifferin their gas-sorption properties.",surface area

Schneider,[a]Iris M. Oppel,[b]Holger Ott,[c]Lorenz G. Lechner,[d]Hans-Jochen S. Hauswald,[e]Raphael Stoll,[e]and Michael Mastalerz*[a]IntroductionPorous organic materials consisting only of discrete mole-cules[1]have been neglected for a long time, since the sur-face areas, stabilities and functionalities could not competeto the achieved values of 3D polymeric structures such asmetal organic frameworks (also termed coordination poly-mers),[2]covalent organic frameworks (and similar system)[3]or zeolites.[4]Reasons for that are considered as follows: Itwas and still is very difficult to predict packing of small mol-ecules in the crystalline state, especially if the molecules in-teract only by weak supramolecular forces to form porousstructures. Although many improvements have been madein the last decade for the prediction of crystal structures ofrather simple molecules,[5]it is remaining a major challengefor bigger molecules.[6]Many crystalline organic systemswere found containing large void space or pores[7]filled witha number of disordered solvent molecules. Unfortunately,most of the porous organic crystals are not stable and col-lapse during removal of enclathrated solvents from thechannels and voids, which demonstrate that solvent mole-cules interact in a stabilizing way with the pore walls andare crucial for the pore formation. In order to distinguishthe stable porous systems, in which the pores can be emp-tied accompanied by remaining of the overall structure,from those unstable systems, in which it is not possible toremove solvent without collapsing of the porous networkstructure, Barbour defined the stable structures as ※perma-nent porous§.",this paper's author
