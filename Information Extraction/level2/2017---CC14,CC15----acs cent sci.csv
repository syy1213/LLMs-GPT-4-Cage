Flack parameter T0.6(7). Single crystals of CC14 TR were small and very weakly diffracting. Due to XTray data quality the final refinement statistics were poor (PLAT082_ALERT_2_A, PLAT084_ALERT_3_A, GOODF01_ALERT_2_B, PLAT087_ALERT _2_B, and PLAT340_ALERT_3_B checkCIF alerts) and diffuse scat ter beyond 0.9 ? was omitted during refinement (THETM01_ALERT_3_B checkCIF alert ). The asymmetric unit for (CC14 TR)¡¤0.5(CH 2Cl 2) comprises 1/12 of a cage fragment and a partially  occupied CH 2Cl 2 located in the intrinsic CC14 TR cavity. In the structure, the methyl group (C7B) i s disordered over and was refined with a site occupancy of 0.25.  It was not possible to accurately determine H atom positions, in particular, for the disordered methyl group. As a result, H atoms were placed in estimated positions and refine d using the riding model. Taking into account close HTH contacts in the structure these H  atom positions are unlikely to be correct (PLAT412_ALERT_2_A and PLAT413_ALERT_2_A checkCIF a lerts). Due to disorder, the aromatic ring and its substituents were refined wit h a planetary restraint (FLAT in SHELX).",CCDC

"Nitrogen sorption measurements for CC14 ¦Áat 77 K and1 bar displayed a type I isotherm, as rationalized by thecrystal structure, which mirrors the isotherm shape of CC3¦Á(Figures 2 m,n and S35). The overall nitrogen uptake andapparent BET surface area for CC14 ¦Á(4.11 mmol g?1,320 m2g?1) are slightly lower than for CC3¦Á(4.50 mmol g?1,409 m2g?1).38This decrease in speci ?c surface area and gasuptake can be explained by the reduction in pore volumeassociated with the introduction of the methyl groups andthe accompanying increase in molecular mass of the cage: thesealso block o ?some of the pore channels ( Figure 2 j). Thesorption properties of this material with respect to other gases(H2,C O 2, Xe, Kr) followed a similar trend, with slightly loweruptakes than for CC3¦Áin each case ( Figures S35 and S36 ).",surface area

Hence, precise control of poresize, pore shape, and pore connectivity are needed to tailor them forspeci?c applications. However, for porous molecular crystals, themodi?cation of pore size by adding pore-blocking groups can alsoa?ect crystal packing in an unpredictable way. This precludesstrategies adopted for isoreticular metal ?organic frameworks, whereaddition of a small group, such as a methyl group, does not a ?ect thebasic framework topology. Here, we narrow the pore size of a cagemolecule, CC3, in a systematic way by introducing methyl groups into the cage windows. Computational crystal structureprediction was used to anticipate the packing preferences of two homochiral methylated cages, CC14 -RandCC15 -R, and toassess the structure ?energy landscape of a CC15 -R/CC3-Scocrystal, designed such that both component cages could bedirected to pack with a 3-D, interconnected pore structure. The experimental gas sorption properties of these three cage systemsagree well with physical properties predicted by computational energy ?structure ?function maps.",this paper's author
