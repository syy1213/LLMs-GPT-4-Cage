"Already a tert-butyl substituted  congener of  [4+6] -endo -cage 1 (Figure 1) is very badl y soluble in various solvents at room temperature,[20a]  so that originally an in -situ reduction of imine to amine -bonds was applied to indirectly proof the formation of the twelve imine bonds and thus the cage.[20a] Later on, it turned out that in hot DMSO -d6 a clean 1H NMR spectrum can be recorded even from the imine cage and crystals were grown from slowly cooling down this solution.[20b]  The tert-butyl groups made the compound at least slightly soluble in hot DMSO. If these are substituted by methyl -groups , the solub ility significantly decreased,[16a] and in case of hydrogens (1) at these positions, the resulting cage needed 22 days to form and was insoluble in all organic solvents.[16a, 21] As a consequence, the only analytical tools to characterize these cages were MALDI -TOF MS, IR, elemental analysis and gas -sorption.",topology
"In the case of 1 and 2 amorphous materials with small crystalline contribution s were obtained at concentrations of c(1) = 7.0 mmol L-1 (of triaminotrip tycene 4) in THF ( 1) or DMAc (2). Decreasing the concentration to c = 1.4 mmol L-1 led to the formation of crystals after 14 (for 1) or 28 days (for 2), proven by PXRD  (Figure 2, see also discussion below) which  were isolated in 18% ( 1) and 53% ( 2) yield. For the cubic [4+4] cage 3 this approach failed and an amorphous yellow solid was obtained from DMF already after 2 h ours. This mixture was kept at the elevated temperature  from which orange crystals slowly grew by Ostwald ripening[23] and after 11 days first single crystals were f ound.  After three months, single -crystalline material 3cr (see discussion below) could be collected in 7% yield by sedimentation using a pipette technique .[16a, 20b, 24]   Figure 2.

"All cage compounds are ins oluble in common organic solvents and have  thus been analysed using solid state 13C-MAS -NMR and IR -spectroscopy, LDI -TOF mass spectrometry, as well as elemental analysis (see Supporting Information). In LDI -TOF mass spectrometry the corresponding protonated molecular ion peaks at m/z 1881.6428 ( 1; calc. for C128H81N12O6+: 1881.6402), m/z 2061.7054 ( 2; calc. for  C134H93N12O12+: 2061.7036) and m/z 2525.7690 ( 3: calc . for.

In 13C-MAS -NMR signals in the typical region of imine carbon atoms (¦Ä = 160-170 ppm)  can be found  and the lack of signals in the region of aldehyde carbon atoms indicate completed condensations  (see Supporting Information) . While the spectra obtained for the cubic [4+4] -cage 3 are in correspon dence to the spectrum of its amorphous analogue published before,[18b] the spectrum of the exo-substituted [4+6] -cage 2 this time shows a well-resolved signal pattern with a conclusive assignment of the imine ( ¦Ä = 163.9  ppm), bridgehead ( ¦Ä = 54.3 ppm) and methyl carbons ( ¦Ä = 5.5 ppm; see Supporting Information). This is further supported by IR -spectroscopy where no carbonyl bands have been  detected  and the spectra correspond to the ones published before[18] (see Supporting Information) .",topology

This dimerization motif can be considered as a main driving force in the packing of the reported imine cages as it can be found in all structures dis cussed in this report as well as the methyl - and tert-butyl substituted congeners of [4+6] -endo cage 1,[16a, 20b] but not in the soluble congeners published before[16b] (see discussion below).",topology
"Single crystals of [4+6] -exo cage 2 suitable for SCXRD analysis  where obtained directly from the reaction mixture as described above (Figure 2). 2 crystallized in the trigonal space group R3? with Z = 6 and with one third of the cage in the asymmetric unit (Figure 3i). This time, the central resorcinol units can be found alternating in an almost co -planar (? = 6.83-9.78¡ã) or distorted ( ? = 28.4-36.0¡ã) alignment with the adjacent triptycene paddles  (Figure 3i). The packing is mainly driven by ¦Ð -¦Ð-interactions of the resorcinol -bisimine units with d¦Ð-¦Ð = 3.51-3.60 ?. This interaction is found in all directions (Figure 3j -l) forming layers in the crystallographic ab plane (Figure 3m),  resulting in a thre e-dimensional porous framework with channels along the crystallographic b axis (Figure 3n).",topology
"In case of the [4+4] cube 3 two different crystal modifications have formed  (Figure 4). The crystalline material obtained from the reaction mixture after ripening and sedimentation (Figure 2) crystalized in the tetragonal space group I41/a with Z = 8 (Figure 5a-g) as truncated octahedra (Figure 4)  and is denoted as modification  3¦Á. A second modification ( 3¦Â) was obtained at a crystallization temperature of 150 ¡ãC as rhombic prisms (Figure 4). This time , the [4+4] cube crystallized in the monoclinic space group C2/c with Z = 4. In both cases identical  ¦Ð-¦Ð-interaction motifs with d¦Ð-¦Ð = 3.37-3.60 ? were  found (Figure 5b and 5d). For modification 3¦Á this interaction propagate s along the crystallographic ab plane equally in four directions forming  inter-cage -voids with diameters of da = 1.10 nm and db = 1.07  nm (Figure 5e). Modificati on 3¦Â show s these interactions two times in the same window on the opposing sides  of the cubes resulting in inter-cage -voids of da = 0.49  nm and db = 1.91 nm (Figure 5h). For both modifications , layer -like alignments are found along the crystallographic b axes (Figures 5f and 5i) and the packing leads to a three-dimensional porous structure  in both cases (Figures 5g and 5j). The denser packed arrangement of the cube in modification 3¦Â is also reflected by its higher density of 0.892  g cm-3 vs 0.618  g cm-3 (3¦Á) and a higher overall packing energy (calculated  by the UNI -force -field method implemented in the Mercury program)[26] of -480.5 kJ mol-1 in comparison to  -434.8 kJ mol-1 (3¦Á).",topology
"The diffractograms of the activated materials obtained  by PXRD were compared to those  calculated from the SCXRD measurements discussed above (Figure 6). The single crystalline material of [4+6] endo cage 1 showed pronounced signals in PXRD measurements both before and after activation (denoted as 1cr), yet in comparison to data calculated from SCXRD a structural rearrangement during  thermal activation can be assumed because for example the five peaks between 2¦È = 8.13-9.32¡ã are missing. For a direct comparison of 1cr to its amorphous analogue, 1 was s ynthesised with TFA and stirring and the fully amorphous material 1am (as proven by PXRD, see Supporting Information) was isolated in 92% yield.[21] 10.1002/chem.202302116Accepted ManuscriptChemistry - A European JournalThis article is protected by copyright.

"In the case of [4+6] -exo-cage 2, the diffractograms of the crystalline material (before and after activation) was in good agreement to the one  calculated from SCXRD (Figure 6e, thus denoted as 2cr1). In contrast to [4+6] -endo cage 1 and the synthesis of the amorphous  phase  2am[18a] of [4+6] -exo-cage 2 published before, a second crystalline material ( 2cr2) was obtained under stirring and acid catalysis, yet this time leading to smaller crystallites as indicated by SEM (see Supporting Information).",topology
"The single crystalline material  of [4+4] -cube 3 also remains crystalline after activation ( 3cr, see Supporting Information). The comparison of the corresponding PXRDs with diffractograms calculated from the SCXRD proves, that the two modifications 3¦Á and 3¦Â can be found in 3cr by signals at 2¦È = 8.8¡ã, 10.2¡ã and 12.5¡ã (corresponding to 3¦Á; indicated in blue in Figure 6f ) and 2¦È = 8.5¡ã, 10.5¡ã and 12.5¡ã (corresponding to 3¦Â indicated in red in Figure 6f) supporting the observation by optical microscopy (Figure 4). The solids coll ected from the supernatant suspension of the sedimentation during the synthesis of 3 (see discussion above) still show  sharp signals indicating crystalline proportions, yet with a recognizable amorphous background (thus denoted as 3cr/am) and can be furthe r compared to the fully amorphous material 3am reported before.[18b]   All isolated solids where investigated by gas sorption analyses and compared to  the amorphous materials  published before (Figure 6 and Table 1).[18] For all three cages, the crystalline phases show almost 1.5 -2 times higher specific surface areas in nitrogen sorption experiments at 77 K than the corresponding amorphous materials (see  Table 1) with mainly type-I isotherms (Figure 6g).  This can most likely be explained by a denser packing o f the amorphous materials in comparison to the corre sponding crystalline ones and partially  blocking of pores in the amorphous states , leading to a main contribution of the intrinsic pores of the cage cavities to the overall surface in the amorphous materi als. In the crystalline states additional extrinsic pores between the single cages contribute to the overall specific surface areas[16a] which was also observed for giant cubic [8+12] -cage compounds before.[25a] It is worth mentioning that for  smaller porous organic cages the opposite behavior with increased surface areas in the amorphous state s was reported .[22d, 29]  10.1002/chem.202302116Accepted ManuscriptChemistry - A European JournalThis article is protected by copyright.

The amorphous material of the [4+6] -endo cage 1 shows a higher isosteric heat of adsorption ( 1am: Qst = 29.8  kJ mol-1) as the crystalline analogue ( 1am: Qst = 20.7 kJ mol-1) and similar trends  can be found for the  partially amorphous material 3cr/am (Qst = 44.7 kJ/mol ) in comparison to 3cr (Qst = 25.5 kJ/mol). This is further reflected in the resulting IAST as well as Henry selectivities (Table 1 and Figure 6i) with the amorphous materials 1am (SIAST = 26.6; SH = 53.8) and 3am (SIAST = 21.5; SH = 24.8) 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0012345   Uptake  [mmol g-1]p [bar]5 10 15 20 25 30 352q [¡ã]5 ¦Ìm 4 ¦Ìm 2 ¦Ìm0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.00100200300400500600Uptake   [cc g-1]Relative pressure  P/P0         1cr1am2cr12cr22cr23cr5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Normalized Intensity2q [¡ã]8.2 9.4 11.0 23.4 12.7 13.2 13.8 14.3 17.4 21.1 preactivationpost activationcalc.

"This general trend can best be  explained by the alignment of the functional groups in both , the molecular structures and as a result  in the crystal packing. For cages 1 and 3 the hydroxy groups point inside to the cages ¡¯ cavities enabling the interaction  with gases of high polarizability  such as carbon dioxide  (¦Á¡¬ = 27.250  au-3, ¦Á¡Í = 13.018  au-3).[32] In the crystalline states, additional extrinsic pores are formed leading to higher surface areas (Table 1 and discussion above) yet without any further decoration with polar groups. In  the amorphous materials, mainly  the intrinsic pores inside the cage cavity contribute to the surface area which leads to a higher functional group to surface area ratio resulting in higher selectivities showing some superior properties of selected amorphous materials as observed  before.[22d, 25a, 29b] This also explains why cage 2 with its exo facing functional groups show s by far the lowest selectiv ities of carbon dioxide over nitrogen ( 2cr1: SIAST = 8.1; SH = 8.1; 2cr2: SIAST = 13.4; SH = 13.4; Table 1) and the highest selectivities can be found for [4+4] -cube 13 with its twelve salicylimine functions in total .",topology
