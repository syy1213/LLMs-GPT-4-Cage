The self -assembly solution of La2A23 or Lc2A23 in CDCl 3 were used directly for the crystallization, 0.3 mL of the solution was passed through a 0.22 ¦Ìm filter into one 1 mL clean glass tube.

"reported23 that the condensation between a trisaldehydes and a series of diamines  containing polymethylene chains  could occur in either [2+3] or [4+6] manner, depending on whether an odd or even nu mber of methylene units  were present in the bisamino  precursors . Zhang19, 24 -25 discovered that angle and directionality of the reacting groups play important roles in determining the yields of  self-assembled products. Mukherjee26 discovered that the geometry or rigidity of the precursors could affect the self -assembly of organic cages.  Mastalerz10, 27 -30 demonstrated that by employing intramolecular hydrogen bondi ng to control the orientation of imine bonds, a variety of cages could be self -assembled in high yields. More recently, the Mastalerz31  group and us32 independently reporte d that using steric hindrance to preorganize the conformation of the building blocks can help to increase the yields of self -assembled tetrahedral cages. In the current report , we further studied  the impact of  building block conformation  on the self -assemb ly pathway by condensing  three closely related tri sformyl derivatives  and tris(2 -aminoethyl)amine (TREN, A1). In particular, we show that a trisformyl precursor with a twisted conformation favor s the formation of a tetrahedral cage .",topology

Effect of precursor stoichiometry on self-assemb ly outcome  In the main text, we have demonstrated that condens ing either La  or Lb  with A1  in 1:1 ratio in CDCl 3 produces the corresponding [4+4] condensation prod ucts, namely La 4A1 4 and  S24  Lb4A1 4 as the major products. We also investigated the se lf(assembly products by using different stoichiometry of the precursors by using 1H NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Generally, La 4A1 4 and Lb4A1 4 were produced as the major products in a very broad range of La :A1  or Lb :A1  ratios. For example, Lb4A1 4 is the major self(assembly product when the Lb :Al ratios vary from 2:1 to 1:4. However, it is notewo rthy that when the amino(to(aldehyde ratio is much smaller or larger t han 1:1, some other self(assembled products might be generated. For example, condensin g a 10:1 mixture of La  and A1  produced a capsule(shaped compound, La 3Al2, whereas a 1:10 mixture of La  and A1  produced a prismatic cage, La 2Al3, as inferred from the 1H NMR spectra and MS studies (cf.",topology
"In the case of Lb  the situation differs. Here, a 10:1 mixture of Lb and A1  produced only a library of oligomeric or polymeric species, leaving  substantial amount of Lb  unreacted; condensing a 1:10 mixture of Lb and A1  yielded the tetrahedral cage Lb4Al4 as the major product, accompanied by the [1+3] product, LbAl 3 (Figure S41). The observation that the prism Lb2Al3 was not produced in the presence of excess A1  is consistent with the conclusion described in the main text, namely that Lb stabilizes CH?¦Ð interactions in tetrahedron self(assembly while can hardly support ¦Ð?¦Ð interactions for prism formation.",topology
"S25   Figure S39.   1H NMR spectra of the reaction mixture of La  and A1  at different molar ratios (400 MHz, CDCl 3, 298K). Bottom: 1H NMR spectrum of pure La . A [2+3] condensation product, assigned as La 2A1 3, was produced from the 1:10 mixture of La  and A1 , whose resonances are labeled with blue arrows. A [3+2] condensation product, assigned as La 3A1 2, was produced from a 2:1 mixture of La  and A1 , whose resonances are labeled with red arrows.",topology
"S26   Figure S41.  1H NMR spectra of the reaction mixture of Lb  and A1  at different molarity ratios (400 MHz, CDCl 3, 298K). Bottom: 1H NMR spectrum of pure Lb . Based on these analyses, it is inferred that a [4+4] condens ation product, namely Lb 4A1 4, is produced from the 1:1 mixture of Lb  and A1  and that a [1+3] condensation product, namely LbA1 3, is produced from a 1:55 mixture of Lb  and A1 .",topology
