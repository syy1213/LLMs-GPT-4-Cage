"IntroductionPorous molecular materials, such as porous organic cages(POCs), are a sub-class of porous materials that lack the3-dimensional extended bonding found in networks such aszeolites, metal 每organic frameworks (MOFs), and covalentorganic frameworks (COFs). POCs are molecules that haveintrinsic porosity as a result of an internal cavity that can beaccessed through multiple windows.1,2In the solid state, thesemolecules can pack together to a ?ord a 1-, 2-, or 3-D porenetwork that passes through the internal cage cavities; the intrin-sic porosity of the cage may be augmented by extrinsic voidslocated between the cages. POCs have shown potential in appli-cations such as chemical separations,3sensing4,5and as porousliquids.6Because of their molecular nature, one can control bothcrystal phase, the degree of crystallinity and, hence, the porosityby post-synthetic processing.7每12This can be done by varying thesolvent, the crystallisation temperature, the mixing rate, or bymodifying the desolvation process. For example, cages can bedirected to form 3-D interconnected pore networks simply bychanging the crystallisation solvent,13or made intentionallyamorphous using techniques such as freeze-drying.7Conventionally, porous materials 〞both molecular solidsand frameworks 〞tend to be synthesised from highly sym-metric precursors to generate crystalline structures. The use ofbuilding blocks with reduced symmetry to construct suchmaterials results in a larger number of possible structuralisomers, and thus a greater phase space of structural possibili-ties. This makes purposeful design based on chemical knowl-edge much more challenging than for more symmetrical pre-cursors. Mukherjee et al. have recently observed a self-selectionprocess between multiple structural isomers when an unsym-metrical ditopic building block was employed for the synthesisof imine cages,14but such processes are very hard to antici-pate. In the area of frameworks, Zhang et al. showed that itwas possible to obtain COFs with heterogeneous pore struc-tures by using a C2vtritopic building block.15These studiessuggest that introducing asymmetric building blocks, or redu-cing the overall symmetry of the building blocks, has thepotential to create increased structural complexity and henceaccess to novel properties. For porous molecular materials,reduced symmetry has the potential to increase porosity of thematerials, by frustrating e ?cient packing, or to dramaticallyimprove solubility.?Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Full high throughputsynthetic and experimental details, gas sorption, TGA, and NMR data, togetherwith computational methodology details, structural and electronic properties forall 36 isomers, structures of all of the 36 DFT optimised isomers, and the amor-phous structure model.

"The cage was rigid and microporous, as predicted by the simulations, with an apparent Brunauer 每Emmett 每Teller surface area of 578 m2g?1. The reduced symmetry of the tritopic building block relative toits topicity meant there were 36 possible structural isomers of the cage. Experimental characterisationsuggests a single isomer with 12 unique imine environments, but techniques such as NMR could not con-clusively identify the isomer. Computational structural and electronic analysis of the possible isomers wasused to identify the most likely candidates, and hence to construct a 3-dimensional model of the amor-phous solid. The rational design of unsymmetrical cages using building blocks with reduced symmetryo?ers new possibilities in controlling the degree of crystallinity, porosity, and solubility, of self-assembledmaterials.",surface area

The N 2and H 2uptake was 13.1 mmol g?1and4.7 mmol g?1, respectively (1 bar, 77 K) (Fig. S33 ?). Thissuggested to us the presence of an intrinsic cavity in the cage,based on our prior experience of amorphous cage solidsformed from more symmetrical cages where the cavity col-lapses to form a non-porous material.",surface area

This further validates that isomer 1is aplausible identity for this cage. For further details and struc-tural properties for the amorphous model of isomer 1, see ESITable S10 and Fig. S44 in section 5.8. ?Intriguingly, when we analysed the cage molecules in theamorphous model, we found that 83% of the potential intrin-sic void volume inside the cages was lost due to interpenetra-tion from neighbouring cages. This was due to the largewindows in isomer 1; as such, the majority of the porosity inthis model comes from extrinsic voids, not from cage cavities.",surface area

"In POC systems where the PLD is close to that of the guest of intere st, as amorphous isomer 1 is to N 2, reducing the probe size from the kinetic radius to the van der Waals radius (representing the minimum cross -section of a N 2 molecule diffusing ※end -on§ through a pore) can assist in uncovering surface area that would be realised through dynamic porosity mechanisms.33 For example, for CC3-R,10 which has a PLD of 3.62 ?32 and SA BET of 409 ? 9 m2 g-1 in crystalline form,34 we calculate a surface area  in Zeo++ of 527 m2 g-1 with a probe of 1.55 ? and of 286 m2 g-1 with a probe of 1.82 ?. In other words, the experimental SA BET sits between the values calculated with the two different sized probes to represent N 2.",surface area
"For the amorphous isomer 1 model, the calculated surface areas range from 456 m2 g-1 to 837 m2 g-1, for probes of 1.82 ? and 1.55 ? respectively.

This precursor also led to predictedshape-persistent cages by in silico combination with di ?erentdiamine partners (3 shape-persistent combinations predictedin total). Of the 84 potential diamine partners selected fromthe Reaxys database, the C2symmetric (1 R,2R)-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine (( R,R)-CHDA) was particularly promising and com-mercially available. This diamine has also been used pre-viously to synthesise a number of POCs, including CC3,formed with the tritopic aldehyde (Fig. 1b),18and TCC1-3 ,formed with tetratopic aldehydes.19A high-throughput (HT) experimental screen of trialdehyde1with 16 diamine partners (see further details in the ESI,section 3 ?), also identified ( R,R)-CHDA (Fig. 1b) as a promisingcage-forming partner, with the formation of a [4 + 6] cage indi-cated by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) (Fig. S5 ?).",topology
"Optimisation and scale-up of the reaction between trialde-hyde 1and ( R,R)-CHDA resulted in the formation of a [4 + 6]cage molecule with 96% mass recovery and 91% (a/a) purity asanalysed by HPLC. Based on our previous experience, theobserved stability of the cage to solvent removal suggested thatthe cage might be shape-persistent, because cages that lackshape-persistence quite often also exhibit some chemicaldecomposition along with collapse of the cage cavity.",topology
"20,21A single peak in the HPLC suggested the formation of a singlecage species (Fig. S12 ?). However, the1H NMR spectra was verycomplex by comparison with spectra usually observed for sym-metrical cages (Fig. 2b, Fig. S45 and S46 ?): for example, the[4 + 6] cage CC3 (Fig. 1b) displays a single chemical shift forall 12 imine protons and a single chemical shift for the 12 aro-matic protons. This complex NMR suggested that the reactionwith trialdehyde 1either forms a mixture of cage isomers, or asingle highly unsymmetrical cage isomer. To aid characteris-ation, further purification was carried out by preparative-HPLCto a?ord the unsymmetrical cage with >98% (a/a) purity.",topology
"Despite the complexity of the1H NMR spectra, which couldsuggest the presence of cage isomers, the integration of thepeaks as whole numbers before and after purificationsuggested instead that a single cage had formed, rather than amixture of species. To further confirm this, di ?usion NMR wasused to determine both the size of the cage in solution and toestablish whether a mixture of cages with varying shapes (andsizes) had formed. The measured solvodynamic diameter ofthe cage was 18.6 ?, which is consistent, by comparison withprevious measurements, with a [4 + 6] cage containing aninternal cavity (Table S11 ?). A single size of cage species wassuggested because all peaks had identical di ?usion co-e?cients, as illustrated by the1H DOSY spectra (Fig. 2d,Table S4 ?).",topology
"Furthermore, there was evidence of connectivity between thesefaces by through-space interactions observed in the 1D-NOEs 每see Fig. S28. ?This suggests the formation of a single [4 + 6]cage that has no symmetry ( C1symmetry).",topology
"20Taking the experimental data as a whole suggests the for-mation of a single, completely unsymmetrical, shape-persist-ent [4 + 6] cage. To our knowledge, this is the first example ofits kind among POCs. The cage was found to be extremelysoluble (>400 mg mL?1in CHCl 3) compared to previouslyreported symmetrical cages (see Fig. S35 ?), for example, CC3has‵3m gm l?1solubility in CHCl 3.24This is presumablybecause of disruption of the lattice packing in this highlyunsymmetrical molecule, and highlights the potential advan-tage to exploring lower symmetry cage molecules.",topology
"Without a single crystal to definitively solve the structure ofthe cage molecule, we again turned to computational model-ing, following the computational pipeline summarised inFig. 3. There are two possible cage topologies, Tri4Di6andTri42Di6,25that would lead to the [4 + 6] molecular mass ionidentified by HRMS ([M + 2H]2+759.9211 g mol?1; Fig. S29 ?).",topology

"During the screening of the R eaxys database, cages were assembled into the ?????????????? topology (Figure 1b) and low energy conformers were searched for, as described later in Section 5.4, this involved sampling molecular dynamics simulations for low energy structures. The precursor s selected from Reaxys consisted of diamines, triamines, dialdehydes and S47  trialdehydes that can undergo a [4+6] imine condensation reaction to form an imine cage. We removed all precursors that were charged systems, radical systems, contained heavy elements  and any duplicates prior to assembly into cage molecules.",topology
"S48  5.3. Cage identification  For t he generation of the unsymmetrical  cage , we considered 2 possible topologies that include 4 trialdehydes and 6 diamines in total, leading to the formation  of 12 imine bonds in the final molecular cage. The first topology corresponds to that typically expected for a  [4+6] molecule, a  ?????????????? topology, as defined in our recent work ,12 whereas the second is the ???????????????? topology.12 Both topologies are shown in Figure 3 in the main text.",topology
