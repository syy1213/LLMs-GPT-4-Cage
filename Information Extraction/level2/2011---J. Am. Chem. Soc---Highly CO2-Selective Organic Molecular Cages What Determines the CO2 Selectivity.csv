In this context,dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC)9,10using reversible cova-lent bond formation has emerged as a powerful tool forconstruction of sophisticated covalently linked nanostruc-tures. Analogous to supramolecular chemistry, DCC is ther-modynamically controlled, thus , presenting self-correctionbehavior and generating the most thermodynamically stablemolecular assembly under appropriate conditions. Reversiblemetathesis (imine, ole ?n, or alkyne) and boronic acid con-densation reactions have led t o successful syntheses of 2-Dand 3-D covalently linked discrete organic assemblies as wellas frameworks.",this paper's author
