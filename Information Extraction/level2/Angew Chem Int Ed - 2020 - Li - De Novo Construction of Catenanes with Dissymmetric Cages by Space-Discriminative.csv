Synthesis of the Interlocked CSCs and CDCs   CSC-1: Linker 1 (150 mg, 0.396 mmol, 1.5 equiv.) was dissolved in chloroform (60 mL), followed by adding catalytic amount of TFA (0.079 mmol, 0.1 equiv.) to afford a slightly turb id solution. A solution of 1,3,5 -triformylbenzene ( 42.8 mg, 0.264 mmol, 1.0 equiv. ) was then added dropwise.  The imine condensation reaction proceeded for 48 h so that  the conver sion of MC-1 to the thermodynamically stable product  CSC-1 can be maximize d. The crude yield of CSC-1 was 63% as determined from the 1H NMR spectrum by using ethyl acetate as internal standard (see Fig ure S12). Purification of CSC -1 was performed on flash chromatographic column packed with silica gel with tertiary solvents of THF/Hexane/Ammonium hydroxide (1:1:0.05), affording a light yellow solid ( 107 mg, 60% isolated yield).",comprehensive synthesis
"For the purpose of facile preparation, the reduc tion of CSC-1 was conducted  by directly adding NaBH(OAc) 3 (1.68 g, 7.92 mmol, 30 equiv.) into the condensation mixture after 48 h. After another 12 h, the solids were filtered off and the filtrate was neutralized with saturated NaHCO 3 solution. The organic phase wa s dried over MgSO 4, concentrated to approximately 1/2 of its original volume and was then slowly evaporated at room temperature, causing the precipitation of pure CDC-1 as a light yellow solid  (53 mg, 30% yield) . The purification of CDC -1 can also be performed using the same protocol as CSC -1, affording a light yellow solid (50% yield).",comprehensive synthesis
