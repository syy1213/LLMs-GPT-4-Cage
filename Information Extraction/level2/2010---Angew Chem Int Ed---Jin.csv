"The overall geometry of the proposed prismatic structurewas confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis. Single crystalswere obtained from a solution of 6in a 1:1:4 mixture ofdichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and hexane. X-ray diffractionanalysis showed that 6had the expected trigonal-prismaticstructure, with six amine bonds and a large central cavity(Figure 1). The two trigonal panels are twisted about 228withrespect to each other; thus, the phenyl arms are not eclipsedbut rotated toward a staggered geometry to minimize stericinteractions. The distance between the top and bottom panelsin this prism structure is about 5.6 /C138, and the diameter at thewidest point is 2.4 nm. To our knowledge, these dimensionsdetermined by X-ray crystallography place compound 6among the largest prismatic molecules constructed from[*] Dr. Y . Jin, Prof. Dr. W.

"Experimental SectionA solution of Sc(OTf)3(32 mg, 0.087 mmol) in CH3CN (10 mL) wasadded dropwise to a solution of 1,3,5-trihexyl-2,4,6-tris(4-amino-phenyl)benzene ( 3; 350 mg, 0.58 mmol) and 1,8-diformylanthracene(4; 204 mg, 0.87 mmol) in chloroform (193 mL). The yellow solutionwas stirred at room temperature for 16 h, and the resulting redsolution was concentrated to give 5. Fresh chloroform (50 mL) wasadded, followed by NaBH(OAc)3(3.69 g, 17.4 mmol), and theresulting yellow suspension was stirred at room temperature for 5 h.",comprehensive synthesis
"The reaction was quenched by the addition of saturated NaHCO3(50 mL), and the mixture was extracted with CHCl3(3 /C148 75 mL). Thecombined organic extracts were dried over Na2SO4and concentratedto give the crude product.
