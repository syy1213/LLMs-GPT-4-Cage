"Department of Inorganic and Physical Chemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560012, India*SSupporting InformationABSTRACT: Unprecedented self-sorting of three-dimen-sional purely organic cages driven by dynamic covalentb o n d si sd e s c r i b e d .F o u rd i ?erent cages were ?rstsynthesized by condensation of two triamines and twodialdehydes separately. When a mixture of all thecomponents was allowed to react, only two cages wereformed, which suggests a high- ?delity self-recognition. Theissue of the preference of one triamine for a particulardialdehyde was further probed by transforming a non-preferred combination to either of the two preferredcombinations by reacting it with the appropriate triamineor dialdehyde.",affiliation

"Synthesis of 1,3-bis(4 -formylphenylethynyl)benzene  (A): In a 100 mL  flame dried double neck  round bottom flask 4 -brom obenzaldehyde (4.40 g, 24 .00 mmol ), PdCl 2(PPh 3)2 (0.30  g, 0.42 S2  mmol) CuI (0.16 g,  0.84 mmol ) and triphenylphosphine  (0.11 g , 0.42 mmol ) were dissolved in 20 m L THF and 20 m L triethylamine followed by addition of 1,3 -diethy nylbenzene  (1.00 g, 8.00 mmol ). The reaction mixture was then  stirred at 75  °„C under nitrogen atmosphere for 24 h. After completion of the reaction volatile solvents were completely removed. The resulting solid mass was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane/CH 2Cl2, 1:3) to obtain a  pale yellow solid  (2.50 g, 92 %) . Analytical data were matched with previously reported data.3  Synthesis of cage A3X2: In a 20 mL glass vial 5 mL  ethanolic solution of 1,3,5 -tris(aminomethyl) -2,4,6 -trimethylbenzene  (X, 2.1 mg, 0.010 mmol) was added drop  wise to the solution  of 1,3-bis(4 -formylphenylethynyl)benzene  (A, 5.0 mg, 0.015 mmol)  in a mixture of 5 mL ethan ol and 1 mL  chloroform with stirring at room temperature. After complete addition of A the reaction mixture was kept for stirring at room temperature for additional  24 h to get a pale yellow solid. The solid mass was filtered and then washed with ethanol for a couple of times to remove unreacted starting materials. Yield:  54 %. Due to low solubility of this cage, 13C NMR could not be obtained.",comprehensive synthesis
"Synthesis of cage A3Y2: In a 20 mL  glass vial 5  ml ethanolic solution of tris(2 -aminoethyl)amine  (Y, 1.5 mg,  0.010 mmol ) was added drop wise to the solution of A (5.0 mg, 0.015 mmol ) in  a mixture of 5  mL ethanol a nd 1 mL  chloroform with stirring a t room temperature. After complete addition of A the reaction mixture was kept for stirring at room temperature for additional 24 h to S3  get a pale yellow solid. The solid mass was then filtered and washed with ethanol for a couple of times to remove unreact ed starting materials. Yield:  73 %.",comprehensive synthesis
"Synthesis of cage B3X2: In a 20 mL  glass vial 5  mL ethanolic solution of X (2.6 mg,  0.013 mmol ) was added drop wise to the solution of  bis(4 -formylphenyl)methane  (B, 4.2 mg, 0.019 mmol  ) in a mixture of 5 mL ethanol and 1 mL  chloroform  with stirring at room temperature.",comprehensive synthesis
After complete addition of X the reaction mixture was kept for s tirring at room temperature for an additional 24 h to get a white precipitate. The precipitate was then  collected by filtration and  washed with ethanol to remove unreacted starting materials. Colorless single crystal s suitable for X-ray analysis were  grown fr om chloroform solution of B3X2 by slow vapor diffusion of n -pentane. Yield: 60 %.,comprehensive synthesis
"Self-sorting experiment  (A+B+X+Y ): In a 20  mL glass vial triamines X (2.1 mg , 0.010  mmol ) and Y (1.5 mg, 0.010 mmol ) were taken in 5 mL ethanol, to  that a mixture of dialdehydes A (5.0 mg, 0.015 mmol ) and B (3.5 mg, 0.015 mmol ) in 5 mL ethanol and 1 mL  chloroform was added and st irred at room temperature for 48  h. The resulting yellow solid mass was washed with ethanol for three to four times to remove unrea cted starting materials and 1H-NMR was checked in CDCl 3.",comprehensive synthesis
