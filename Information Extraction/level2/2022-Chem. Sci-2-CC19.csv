The solution  was heated at 100 oC for 6 h. Approximately 50 mL of 3 M HCl was added  and the solution  was heated at 100 oC for 3 h. After cooling to room temperature, the solution was extracted with ca. 350 mL dichloromethane, dried over sodium sulfate, and filtered.

"Photostable polymorphic organic cages fortargeted live cell imaging ?Dana Al Kelabi, ?aAvishek Dey, ?aLukman O. Alimi,aHubert Piwo ∩nski,bSatoshi Habuchiband Niveen M. Khashab *aFluorescent microscopy is a powerful tool for studying the cellular dynamics of biological systems. Small-molecule organic ?uorophores are the most commonly used for live cell imaging; however, they oftensu?er from low solubility, limited photostability and variable targetability. Herein, we demonstrate thata tautomeric organic cage, OC1 , has high cell permeability, photostability and selectivity towards themitochondria. We further performed a structure 每activity study to investigate the role of the keto 每enoltautomerization, which a ?ords strong and consistent ?uorescence in dilute solutions throughsupramolecular self-assembly. Signi ?cantly, OC1 can passively di ?use through the cell membranedirectly targeting the mitochondria without going through the endosomes or the lysosomes. Weenvisage that designing highly stable and biocompatible self-assembled ?uorophores that can passivelydi?use through the cell membrane while selectively targeting speci ?c organelles will push theboundaries of ?uorescent microscopy to visualize intricate cellular processes at the single molecule levelin live samples.",this paper's author

"OC1, a [2 + 3] cage, was synthesized following a reportedprocedure and its structure was con 祈rmed by1H NuclearMagnetic Resonance (NMR) and TOF-Mass analysis (Fig. S1 每S4?).32Dynamic light scattering (DLS) of OC1 revealed anaverage size of 30 每50 nm in DMSO 每H2O( 2 每5%) with a negativezeta potential of /C05 mV (Fig. S5 ?). Single crystal X-ray analysisrevealed that OC1 crystallizes in a triclinic crystal system withchiral P1 space group and the asymmetric unit consists of twomolecules of [2 + 3] cages (Fig. S6 ?). Crystal structure analysissuggests that the imine cage crystallizes as the keto tautomericform (Fig. 2a).
