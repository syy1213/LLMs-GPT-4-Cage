"2y   Experimental Procedures:  Cryptophane 6:  A solution of cyclotribenzylene 1 1 (17.5 mg, 40 米mol) was suspended in CDCl 3 (4.4 mL). A few beads of molecular sieves (3?) were added, followed by et hylene -1,2-diamine (5.2 米L, 80 米mol) and TFA (20 米L of 1% solution in CDCl 3). The mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight, after which all of 35 had dissolved. The solution was filtered and the solvent evaporated to yield 6 quantitatively as a ye llowish solid. X -ray quality crystals of 6 were obtained by dissolving about 3 mg of 6 in CH 2Cl2/CH 3OH (2:1) and slow evaporation of the solvent at room temperature.

"4yCs2CO 3 (600 mg, 1.84 mmol) and tert. butyl bromoacetate (0.3 mL, 2.03 mmol) was added to the solution. After stirring at room temperature for 24 hrs, the solvent was  removed under reduced pressure. The residue was partitioned between water and CH 2Cl2. The organic layer was washed with brine and dried over MgSO 4. After removing of the solvent, the crude product was chromatographed on silicagel. 35 was eluted with CH 2Cl2/ethyl acetate (9:1) and obtained as a white solid (119.5 mg, 57% yield based on 1).
