"CO2and C 2H2Uptake. The removal of coexisting CO 2impurities from C 2H2to produce high-purity C 2H2is highlyimportant in the ?ne chemical industry. However, theseparation of CO 2and C 2H2is di?cult because they havesimilar molecular sizes and physical characteristics.62,63Theintrinsic porosity, abundant electron-rich ¦Ðcalix[4]-resorcinarene cavities, and oxygen and nitrogen sites inCPOC-101 crystals prompt us to investigate the correspond-ing CO2and C2H2gas sorption and separation. Moreover, weare also interested in how solvatomorphism in ?uences CO2and C 2H2sorption capacities and separation abilities.

"Cite This: ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2021, 13, 24042 ?24050 Read OnlineACCESS Metrics & More Article Recommendations *s?Supporting InformationABSTRACT: Porous organic molecular (POM) materials can exhibit solvatomorphs viaaltering their crystallographic packing in the solid state, but investigating real gas mixtureseparation by porous materials with such a behavior is still very rare. Herein, we report thata lantern-shaped calix[4]resorcinarene-based porous organic cage (POC, namely, CPOC-101) can exhibit eight distinct solid-state solvatomorphs via crystallization in di ?erentsolvents. This POC solvatomorphism has a signi ?cant in ?uence on their gas sorptioncapacities as well as separation abilities. Speci ?cally, the apparent Brunauer ?Emmett ?Teller (BET) surface area determined by nitrogen gas sorption at 77 K for CPOC-101 ¦Ácrystallized from toluene/chloroform is up to 406 m2g?1, which is much higher than therest of CPOC-101 solvatomorphs with BET values less than 40 m2g?1. More interestingly, C2H2and CO2adsorbed capacities, inaddition to the C2H2/CO2separation ability at room temperature for CPOC-101 ¦Á, are superior to those of CPOC-101 ¦Âcrystalizedfrom nitrobenzene, the representative of POC solvatomorphs with low BET surface areas. These results indicate the possibility ofadjusting gas sorption and separation properties of POC materials by controlling their solvatomorphs.",surface area
"Nitrogen Gas Sorption Isotherms. For activated CPOC-101, the permanent porosity was evaluated using N 2gassorption experiments at 77 K. As shown in Figure 3 ,N2uptakeofCPOC-101 ¦Áexhibits a high value as of 130 cm3g?1at 1atm, and its adsorption behavior typically exhibits a type Icurve with a small fraction of type IV adsorption isotherm. Inaddition, CPOC-101 ¦Áexhibits a Brunauer ?Emmett ?Teller(BET) surface area of up to 406 m2g?1(Figure S14 ) and amicropore volume of 0.14 cm3g?1. Its NLDFT pore sizeranges from 0.5 to 0.6 nm, which is close to the channeldiameter of CPOC-101 ¦Áin the crystal structure ( Figure S15 ).",surface area
"A similar situation also appeared in CPOC-101 ¦Â. For CPOC-101¦Â,C O 2breakthrough occurs in 16.4 min, and C 2H2breakthrough did not occur until 25.7 min ( Figure 6 c). Thelonger e ?ective separation time of CPOC-101 ¦Áthan CPOC-101¦Âsuggested that the C 2H2/CO 2separation ability ofCPOC-101 ¦Áis better than that of CPOC-101 ¦Â, consistentwith the trend of the IAST results. According to thebreakthrough experiments, the calculated separation factorsof C2H2/CO 2forCPOC-101 ¦ÁandCPOC-101 ¦Âare 2.2 and2.0, respectively. Furthermore, con ?rming CPOC-101 ¦Ástability can be realized by conducting recycling experiments.AsFigure 6 d displays, the breakthrough time remainsunchanged after four recycling experiments. The long break-through time interval between CO2and C 2H2, as well as thegood recycling performance, further indicates that CPOC-101¦Áis an auspicious system toward C 2H2/CO 2separation.¡öCONCLUSIONSIn summary, eight distinct [2 + 4] dimeric calix[4]-resorcinarene-based porous organic cage ( CPOC-101 ) sol-vatomorphs have been prepared by recrystallization fromdi?erent aromatic and/or CHCl3solvents. To the best of ourknowledge, CPOC-101 not only presents the ?rst example ofthe solvatomorphic phenomenon in the cavitand-based POCsystem but also o ?ers the richest solvatomorphism in the POCsystem. More interestingly, the solvatomorphism is related togas sorption and separation abilities of POCs. Speci ?cally,C2H2and CO 2adsorbed capacities, as well as the C 2H2/CO 2separation ability of CPOC-101 (in this case, CPOC-101 ¦Á)with a higher BET surface (406 m2g?1), are much better thanthe solvatomorphs with a low BET surface ( CPOC-101 ¦Â,3 8m2g?1). Moreover, CPOC-101 also represents the ?rstmaterial to realize the C 2H2/CO 2gas mixture separation inthe POC ?eld. Such an outcome may shed light on controllingsolvatomorphs of POM materials to judicially tailor their gassorption as well as separation abilities.",surface area

Interestingly, wehave also found that the POC solvatomorphism of this cagehas a great in ?uence on N2, acetylene (C 2H2), and carbondioxide (CO 2) gas sorption capacities, as well as on the C 2H2/CO 2separation ability.",topology
