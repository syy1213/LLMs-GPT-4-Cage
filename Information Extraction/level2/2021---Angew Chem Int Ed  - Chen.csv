"Therelationship between CDsignal of2d12/C0andtheratio ofS-propylene oxide and2d12/C0wasshown inFigure S170. Theeevalues were calculated tobe10%based onanassumptionthat apureenantiomer of2d12/C0inwater provides theCDsignal with thesame intensity asthatofapureenantiomer of2binchloroform.1HNMRspectrum indicated thatthechiralguests within thecage cavity could bereplaced byaddition ofexcess amount ofchloroform (Figure S168). After guestexchange ,noremarkable CDsignal attenuation wasobservedfornolessthan seven days (Figure 5),indicating that thechirality of2d12/C0was rather stable inwater. Possibleexplanations include ,i)thecarboxylate units form hydrogenbonds with theprotons inthecentral phenyl units ofthe1d3/C0residues ,ii)awatermolecule bridges twoadjacent carboxyl-ateanions in1d3/C0residues .Suchhydrogen bonds raise theenergy barrier offlipping the phenyl units,preventingracemization of2d12/C0.Suchstrategy ofguest-induced chiralitywasalsoemployed byother groups .[20]ConclusionInsummary ,asetofstructurally similar tetrahedra wereself-assembled bycondensing atrisamino linker andatris-benzaldehyde precursor bearing substitutional units inthemeta positions with respect totheformyl groups .Theformation oftetrahedra isattributed tothetwoortho protonsthat areinvolved ineither CH©{©{©{ pinteractions orhydrogenbonds within thecage framework.

"1f: 1,3,5 -tris(4,4 ,5,5-tetramethyl -1,3,2 -dioxaborolan -2-yl)benzene  (500 mg, 1.10 mmol), 4-bromo -2-methylbenzaldehyde  (764 mg, 3.84 mmol) and Pd(PPh3)4 ( 127 mg, 0.11mmol ) were added to a  mixture of THF (50 mL) and aqueous 1 M potassium carbonate (15 mL). The mixture was  stirred at  80 r under the protection of an atmosphere of N 2 for 24 h . After cooling to room temperature, the crude mixture was diluted with diethyl ether and then washed with brine. The  organic layer was drie d over MgSO 4 and concentrated. Purification by column chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate ( 4:1); silica gel, 200 -300 mesh) yielded a yellow  solid  1f (95 mg, 20%). 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl 3) Ñ´ 10.35 (s, 3H), 7.94 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 3H), 7.87 (s, 3H), 7.70 (dd, J = 7.9, 1.8 Hz, 3H), 7.59 (s, 3H), 2.79 (s, 9H). 13C NMR (151 MHz, CDCl 3) Ñ´ 194.81, 148.11, 144.14, 143.98, 136.15, 135.36, 133.34, 128.95, 127.92, 22.45.
