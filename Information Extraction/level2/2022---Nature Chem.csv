"In contrast to the relatively large number and diversity of inter -locked coordination cages18, only a few examples of purely organic cage catenanes have been reported to date. The first example was reported by Beer et al.23 They exploited a template effect of sulfate anions interacting with carbamate units to prearrange two tripodal precursor molecules in such a way that the end-capping of these via a copper-mediated 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition resulted in the formation of a triply interlocked cage dimer in 21% yield. One year later, in 2010, Cooper and co-workers described that by changing conditions for the synthesis of a [4?+?6] imine cage by adding catalytic amounts of trifluoroacetic acid to the reaction solution in acetonitrile or dichlo -romethane (DCM), these [4?+?6] imine cages form triply interlocked dimers24, which was proven by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. It was suggested that ¶– ®C¶–-stacking is most probably the driving force for the Received: 9 April 2021Accepted: 18 October 2022Published online: xx xx xxxx Check for updatesOrganisch-Chemisches Institut, Ruprecht-Karls-Universit?t Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany. ?e-mail: michael.mastalerz@oci.uni-heidelberg.deNature ChemistryArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41557-022-01094-wnon-interlocked species.

Gross?  ? & Michael Mastalerz?  ? Mechanically interlocked structures, such as catenanes and rotaxanes, are fascinating synthetic targets and some are used for molecular switches and machines. Today, the vast majority of catenated structures are built upon macrocycles and only a very few examples of three-dimensional shape-persistent organic cages forming such structures have been reported. However, the catenation in all these cases was based on a thermodynamically favoured ¶–®C¶–-stacking under certain reaction conditions. Here, we show that catenane formation can be induced by adding methoxy or thiomethyl groups to one of the precursors during the synthesis of chiral [8?+?12] imine cubes, giving dimeric and trimeric catenated organic cages. To elucidate the underlying driving forces, we reacted 11 differently 1,4-disubstituted terephthaldehydes with a chiral triamino tribenzotriquinacene under various conditions to study whether monomeric cages or catenated cage dimers are the preferred products. We find that catenation is mainly directed by weak interactions derived from the substituents rather than  by ¶–-stacking.",this paper's author

"In contrast to the reaction with aldehyde 2, here the 1H NMR spectrum of the crude product was very complex with a large number of peaks in the aromatic as well as in the aliphatic region (Fig. 2b ). The corre -sponding matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization®Ctime of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI®CTOF-MS) revealed that in addition to the [8?+?12] OMe-cube ( m/z ?5,623.21), a [16?+?24] condensation product (m/z ?11,245.46) was generated and even a small peak with m/z ?16,868.53 was detected (Fig. 2c ), suggesting that a larger [24?+?36] species may have formed. Taking into consideration the complex 1H NMR spectra reported previously for triply interlocked cages24, it was assumed that these species are most probably catenated dimer (OMe-cube)2 and trimer (OMe-cube)3 rather than larger more symmetric and Nature ChemistryArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41557-022-01094-wexclusively at m/z ?16,868.69 (first fraction), m/z ?11,245.57 (second frac -tion) and m/z ?5,623.24 (third fraction), which exactly fit to a [24?+?36], a [16?+?24] and a [8?+?12] species, respectively. The 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. 3h) of the third fraction was very simple, showing signals compa -rable to OH-cube, and in combination with the mass spectrum (Fig. 3c )  this compound was clearly identified as the monomeric chiral [8?+?12] OMe-cube. Diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) in deuter-ated DCM at 295?K showed only one trace with a diffusion coefficient of D?=?3.09?°¡?10?10?m2?s?1, which according to the uncorrected Stokes®CEinstein equation corresponds to a solvodynamic radius of rS?=?16.9?? (Supplementary Fig. 308). In contrast to the relatively simple 1H NMR spectrum of monomeric OMe-cube (Fig. 3h), that of the [16?+?24] species was much more complex (Fig. 3i). Nevertheless, despite the large number of signals, most of them were sharp and did not super -impose, allowing a more detailed analysis of the structure (Fig. 4a; for detailed structural analysis, see Supplementary Information,  section 13). Two-dimensional NMR experiments identified eight dif -ferent types of imine protons and eight different methoxy protons  (Fig. 4b,c ). This is exactly the number expected for a triply interlocked cage dimer (see cartoon in Fig. 4h) Other possible catenanes, such as a singly interlocked dimer (Fig. 4g, 12 imine peaks) or quadru -ply interlocked dimer (Fig. 4i, six imine peaks), can clearly be ruled out. DOSY NMR in CD2Cl2 at 295?K showed only one trace of signals for ( OMe-cube)2, confirming that this is a single species. The diffu -sion coefficient D?=?2.67?°¡?10?10?m2?s?1 corresponds to a solvodynamic radius of 19.6?? (Supplementary Fig. 309). This is slightly larger than for OMe-cube (16.9??) which is consistent with its slightly larger size.",topology
