"Crystal Growth and Activation: The crystallization of F-cage is described here as a representative procedure. As-synthesized F-cage (1.20?g) was dissolved in dry THF (400?mL, c? = 3?mg mL?1) and filtered through a syringe filter (0.2? ¦Ìm pore). 10?mL of the filtered cage solution each was added to 40 individual snap-lid jars (25? mL, d? = 3? cm). All vials were capped, with caps with 12 pinched holes each and placed in two desiccators with the ground covered with methanol. After vapor diffusion of methanol into the THF cage solutions at room temperature for 21 days, the mother liquors for every vial were removed by a pipette technique and the residual crystals were washed with a methanol/THF mixture (Vmethanol /VTHF? = ?4/1) (3 ¡Á 2?mL) and methanol (2?mL), again by pipette technique. The crystals of the different batches were combined as suspensions, the supernatant solvents were removed and the residual dried at high vacuum (1.2 mbar) for 14 h at room temperature to give pre-activated F-cage (890? mg, 74% efficiency of the crystal growth/activation procedure). Further activation was achieved by drying at a kugelrohr oven at 50 ¡ãC under reduced pressure (3 ¡Á 10?2? mbar) for 14 h. Prior to gas adsorption measurements, the cage crystals were activated again at 40 ¡ãC for 3 h at the outgas station of the gas sorption analyzer and measured directly. The complete removal of enclathrated solvent molecules was verified by 1H NMR spectroscopic as well as TG analyses (see Section S11, Supporting Information) and the persistence of the crystallinity was monitored by optical microscopy along with SEM as well as PXRD and SCXRD (for detailed descriptions, see Section S12 and S13, Supporting Information).",comprehensive synthesis

"Although some of the crystals appeared cracked, the smaller crystallites still show sharp edges mainly along crystallographic axes. Interestingly, more cracks are apparent for H-cage than for HF-cage and F-cage, which is in line with the strengths of dispersion interactions of the hexameric units of side-chains, as discussed above. Thus, it is assumed that by activation the crystals preferably break along these units. This observed mac-roscopic trend is also reflected by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD; Section S13, Supporting Information). Obviously, the dispersion interactions between fluorinated chains are strong enough to fully maintain single crystallinity for the F-cage upon desolvation and activation, allowing to gain decent diffraction data of the apo-host that is having only a slightly enlarged unit cell (Section S7 and S8, Supporting Information).In nitrogen sorption experiments at 77? K as well as argon sorption at 87? K, only fully fluorinated F-cage took up sig-nificant amounts of gases allowing to determine Brunauer¨CEmmett¨CTeller (BET) surface areas of 752 m2 g?1 (N 2) and 728?m2 g?1 (Ar), respectively, while H-cage and HF-cage seemed apparently nonporous under these conditions (Figure? 3g,h). On first glance, this finding is contradictory to the trend of dispersion interaction strength discussed above. However, this permanent porosity is most likely attributed to a gen-eral higher solubility and thus easier diffusion of gases in fluorinated alkanes in comparison to their hydrocarbon ana-logs.",surface area
"[28] At elevated temperatures of 195?K,?all three cages take up noteworthy and comparable amounts of both nitrogen (H-cage: 0.58? mmol g?1; HF-cage: 0.67? mmol g?1; F-cage: 0.93? mmol g?1) and carbon dioxide (H-cage: 6.63? mmol g?1; HF-cage: 8.92? mmol g?1; F-cage: 8.66? mmol g?1) (see Figure S109, Supporting Information? and Figure? 3i) at 1? bar proving permanent porosity for all three cages. This indicates a kineti-cally hindered adsorption of nitrogen and argon at cryogenic condition for H-cage and HF-cage, which is underlined by pro-nounced hysteresis observed for H-cage and HF-cage and the absence of such for F-cage (Figure? 3i). The BET surface area derived from carbon dioxide adsorption at 195 K of F-cage is with 605 m2 g?1 between the one of H-cage (372? m2 g?1) and HF-cage (653?m2 g?1) (Figure?3j). The similar adsorption prop-erties at higher temperatures are further proven by similar alkane adsorption behaviors of all three cages at 273? K with uptakes of 0.7¨C1.0?wt% (0.46¨C0.61?mmol g¨C1) of methane, 5.6¨C7 .5? wt% (1.50¨C2.49? mmol g?1) of ethane, and 10.5¨C14.6? wt% (2.37¨C3.30?mmol g?1) of propane at 1?bar (see Figures S112¨CS114, Supporting Information). For instance, for F-cage, the propane adsorption corresponds to 9.09?mmol mmol?1 or 9.09 propane molecules per cage compound which resembles a filling of 84% of the cage void (for more details on pore fillings of different gases, see Section S16 and Table S17, Supporting Information).",surface area

Furthermore, the recyclability of F-cage was investigated with seven subsequent adsorption and desorp-tion cycles for c-C4F8 exemplarily (Figure?6c). It has to be noted that the material was stored for 204 days under ambient atmos-phere between cycles 1 and 2 and the uptakes of c-C4F8 were all in a range of 99¨C112% (cycle 1 was set to 100%) demonstrating the potential recyclability of F-cage in these kind of separations.",surface area

General Remarks   Commercially available reagents were obtained from Chempur, Fisher Scientific, abcr, Alfa Aesar, Sigma -Aldrich or VWR and have been used without further purification unless otherwise mentioned. 2,7,14 -triaminotriptycene 1 was synthesized according to a pro cedure reported in literature.[S1] 2-Hydroxy -5-(4,4,5,5 -tetramethyl -1,3,2 -dioxaborolan -2-yl)benzaldehyde S1, 1,4 -dibromo -2,5-dibutyl -benzene S2 and 1,4 -dibromo -2,5-bis(perfluorobutyl)benzene  S8 have been  synthesized according to a procedure s reported in li terature.[S2] Thin layer chromatography was performed with POLYGRAM? SIL G/UV254 gel plates by Macherey -Nagel. Detection was accomplished using UV -light (254 nm).  Flash column chromatography was performed on silica gel from Macherey -Nagel  (particle size: 0 .040-0.063 mm) using petroleum ether, dichloromethane , ethyl acetate  or acetic acid  and their mixtures as eluents . Melting points (not corrected) were measured with a B¨¹chi B-540 m elting point analyzer . NMR spectra were taken on a Bruker DRX 300 (300 MHz), Bruker Avance 300 III (300 MHz), Bruker Avance III 400 (400 MHz) , Bruker Avance III 500 (5 00 MHz)  and Bruker Avance III 700 (7 00 MHz) spectrometer.",this paper's author
