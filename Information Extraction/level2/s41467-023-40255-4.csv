The solid-state sample of 13S6wasobtained by adding MeOH into its solution in chloroform and col-lecting the precipitate via ?ltration. However, it is unsuccessful topurify 13S6via precipitation, accompanied by the generation of someoligomeric or polymeric byproducts. We thus used a NMR yield (60 %)to quantify the production of 13S6, by adding an internal standard inthe NMR sample.",comprehensive synthesis

"In the present work, we employed directing groups to preciselycontrol the self-assembly products based on imine formation. Thesedirecting groups mediate or determine the conformations of thebuilding blocks, by providing hydrogen bonds with different modes tothe latter. Each of these preorgani zed conformations of the buildingblocks favors one speci ?c cage compound that is produced as thepredominant product. To be more speci ?c, a pseudo-linear tetra-formyl precursor containing two isophthalaldehyde units and trans -cyclohexane-1,2-diamine ( trans -CHDA), which is either enantiomeri-cally pure or the racemic mixture, are combined for self-assembly.Subtle variation in the substituents located in each isophthalaldehyderesidue switches the self-assembly products between two types ofconstitutionally different cage molecules, including a [3 + 6] chiralcage and a [2 + 4] achiral cage. In the case of OH unit whose acid protonacts as a hydrogen bond donor, intramolecular hydrogen bonds drivethe two formyls and/or the resultant imine units on both sides toorientate in an exo-endo conformation. Such conformation favors theproduction of a [3 + 6] chiral cage, which is composed of threeequivalents of the tetraformyl precursor and six equivalents of enan-tiomerically pure trans -CHDA. When the racemic trans -CHDA is used inself-assembly, narcissistic self-sorting occurs, generating a pair ofenantiomers of the [3 + 6] chiral cage each containing only one type ofenantiomer of trans -CHDA. As a comparison, an alkoxy substituentcontaining no acidic protons affords the two formyls and/or imines anexo-exoconformation68. When the tetraformyl precursor is combinedwith the racemic mixture of trans -CHDA in a 1:2 ratio, a meso [2 + 4]cage is produced as the only observable product, which is composedof two equivalents of the tetraformyl precursor and four equivalents ofracemic trans -CHDA. More interestingly, when the substituent is anester unit containing protons with modest acidity, both exo-endo andexo-exoconformations become thermodynamically feasible. The self-assembled products are then determined by the chirality of the bisa-mine precursors. That is, enantiomerically pure and racemic bisaminefavor the [3 + 6] and [2 + 4] products, respectively. Physicochemicalanalysis based on NMR spectroscopic results, solid-state structures, aswell as theoretical calculation results indicated that these self-assembly preferences stem from the self-assembly products attempt-ing to minimize intramolecular steric hindrance, by keeping all theimine protons in the syn conformation69,70relative to the corre-sponding adjacent methine proton in the cyclohexyl unit.",topology
"D. means Not Determined, because either the target molecules were not producedwith observable yields, or the products are generated within a library of mixturewhose1H NMR spectrum is too complicated to determine the corresponding yields.Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-40255-4Nature Communications |         (2023) 14:4627 2spectrum (Fig. 2B) was recorded, in which a set of sharp resonanceswere observed, indicating a product with a symmetrical structure wasobtained as the predominant product. Mass spectrum (SupplementaryFig. 28) indicated that this product is a [3 + 6] product, namely com-posed of three equivalents of 1and six equivalents of ( S,S)-CHDA. Thisproduct is referred to as 13S6.I nt h e1H NMR spectrum (Fig. 2B), each ofthe resonances corresponding to the protons in the isophthalaldehyderesidues, including both the imine e/e¡¯and the phenyl c/c¡¯, splits intotwo peaks. This observation indicated that in each isophthalaldehyderesidue, the two imine units have two different orientations, namelyeither exoorendo with respect to the central OH group (Fig. 3B,middle). The framework of 13S6is chiral, resulting from the stereochirality of the ( S,S)-CHDA precursor. The chirality of 13S6was sup-ported by1H NMR spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 29) in which the twoprotons in the methylene fbecome diastereotopic. The solid-statesample of 13S6was obtained by adding MeOH into its solution inchloroform and collecting the precipitate via ?ltration. The solid of13S6was re-dissolved in CDCl 3,w h o s e1H NMR spectrum was essentiallythe same as the before precipitation, indicated that 13S6was ratherkinetically inert and did not undergo observable degradation duringprecipitation and re-dissolving. In the1H NMR spectrum (Fig. 2B) of13S6, a few small broad resonances were observed, indicating thatsome oligomeric or polymeric byproducts were also generated. Thesebroad resonances were not removed, even after we attempted topurify 13S6via precipitation. We thus used NMR yield to quantify theproduction of each cage in this article, by adding an internal standardin the NMR sample. The self-assembly yield of 13S6was determined tobe 60% (Supplementary Fig. 76). The cage 13R6, which is the enantio-mer of 13S6, was also self-assembled in a similar procedure (Supple-mentary Fig. 16C), by condensing 1and ( R,R)-CHDA in CDCl 3.T h ecircular dichroism (CD) spectra (Supplementary Fig. 33B) of both 13S6and 13R6were recorded, showing mirror-like images. When 1wascombined with a racemic mixture of ( R,R)-CHDA and ( S,S)-CHDA inCDCl 3, narcissistic self-sorting71¨C73occurred (Supplementary Fig. 17),yielding a racemic mixture of 13S6and13R6as the major product.",topology

Heating themixture in CDCl 3led to the generation of a library of oligomeric andpolymeric precipitates, instead of a putative [3 + 6] cage namely13(EDA) 6. Such results indicate that conformation preorganization isalso of importance in the bisamino precursors.",topology
"In order to strengthen our proposition that the OH group in 1plays a predominant role in favoring the formation of the corre-sponding [3 + 6] cages namely either 13S6or13R6, we synthesized threeanalogs including 0, 2as well as 3, in which the central OH substituentsin1are replaced by other units namely H, alkyloxy and ester respec-tively. The precursor 0can be considered as a counterpart of 1withoutany directing groups. 0and ( S,S)-CHDA were combined in CDCl 3in a1:2 ratio. After heating the corresponding solution at 50 ¡ãC for 4 h, the1H NMR spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 23A) indicated that an analog of13S6, namely 03S6was produced as the major product, accompaniedwith a [2 + 4] product 02S4as a kinetic product. The formation of both03S6and02S4was convinced by mass spectrometry (SupplementaryFig. 24). Further heating the reaction mixture for 120 h converted most02S4into03S6, as inferred from the observation that the molecular ionpeak corresponding to the [2 + 4] product weakened signi ?cantly(Supplementary Fig. 25). Even heating the solution for no less than120 h, the resonances corresponding to 02S4with small intensity werestill observable in the1H NMR spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 23C),indicating that the conversion from 02S4into03S6was not complete.",topology
"We then combined either 2or3(2.5 mM) with a racemic mixtureoftrans -CHDA in a 1:2 ratio in CDCl 3. After heating at 50 ¡ãC for 6 h, the1H NMR spectra (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. 48) and mass spectra(Supplementary Figs. 34 and 47) of both solutions were recorded. Massspectrum indicated that in both cases, [2 + 4] products were gener-ated. That is, each product is composed of two equivalents of tetra-formyl precursors (i.e., 2or3) and four equivalents of trans -CHDA,namely either ( S,S)-CHDA or ( R,R)-CHDA.",topology
"When the racemic trans -CHDA was replaced by enantiomeric pure(S,S)-CHDA, self-assembly yielded totally different products. Heating a1:2 mixture of 2(2.5 mM) and ( S,S)-CHDA in CDCl3produced a library ofmixture, whose1H NMR spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 19B) showed aset of irregular resonances. Such observation indicated that theputative chiral cage namely 22S4is not a thermodynamically favoredproduct. The putative cage 22S4can be considered as a chiral coun-terpart of 22R2S2,i nw h i c ht w o( R,R)-CHDA residues are replaced bytwo ( S,S)-CHDA residues. However, in 22S4,f o u ro ft h ee i g h ti m i n eprotons adopt the thermodynamically disfavored anti conformation(Supplementary Fig. 19) with respect to the adjacent methine protons,making its formation less favored. Another putative product, namely23S6, an analog of 13S6, was not observed in either1H NMR spectrum ormass spectrum. This is not surprising, given that the [3 + 6] productsrequire the exo-endo conformation, while the alkyloxy directinggroups in 2,f a v o rt h e exo-exoconformation in contrast.",topology
"To our surprise, combining the tetraaldehyde 3(2.5 mM) and(S,S)-CHDA in CDCl3in a 1:2 ratio yielded a product whose1HNMRspectrum (Fig. 5B) was in reminiscence of the aforementioned [3 + 6]product namely 13S6. Mass spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 57) con ?rmsthat a chiral cage 33S6was self-assembled as the predominant product,whose yield was determined to be 63 % (Supplementary Fig. 81). Asoccurred in 13S6, the resonances corresponding to two imine protonsin33S6also split into two peaks (Fig. 5B), indicating that the two imineswithin each isophthalaldehyde residue adopt an exo-endo conforma-tion. The exo-endo conformation was also supported by the NOESYspectrum (Supplementary Fig. 61) of 33S6. That is, while the endo imineproton e¡¯undergoes coupling with one phenyl proton c¡¯in the iso-phthalaldehyde residue, the exoimine proton eundergoes couplingwith the CH 2proton kin the central side chain. The exo-endo con-formation in the case of 33S6was also driven by the formation of twodifferent types of hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3D, middle). That is, onehydrogen bond forms between exoimine proton eand the centraloxygen atom, while the second one forms between the endo iminenitrogen atom and the proton in the methylene unit h/h¡¯in ethyl unit ofthe ester. The occurrence of the latter hydrogen bonding results fromthe electron-withdrawing inductive effect of the ester oxygen atom,which renders the protons h/h¡¯relatively acidic. Such relatively acidicprotons are absent in the case of 2containing n-butoxy chains. It istherefore not surprising that 2did not form the putative cage 23S6.T h eoccurrence of CH ?N hydrogen bonding forces in 33S6is supported byits1HNMR spectrum (Fig. 5B), in which the resonances correspondingto the methylene unit h/h¡¯in the ester split into two peaks, while themethylene unit kexhibits a singlet. In order to further strengthen ourhypothesis that the acidic ester proton plays an important role in cageformation, we thus synthesized another tetraformyl precursor 4(seeits molecular formula in Fig. 1) containing tert-butyl acetate units. 4contains ester functions while does not contain the protons withmodest acidity as those in 3. Combining 4and ( S,S)-CHDA in a 1:2 ratioyielded a library of mixture (Supplementary Fig. 22), instead of 43S6.",topology

Furthermore, combining a mixture of pre-synthesized33S6and 33R6with a 1:1 ratio also yielded the meso cage 32R2S2.",topology
"DiscussionIn summary, an ingenious approach to precisely control the self-assembly product based on imine condensation is developed, byintroducing different directing groups to favor speci ?c target pro-ducts. When a tetraformyl precursor containing two iso-phthalaldehyde units and trans -CHDA are combined, the self-assemblyproducts are very sensitive to the variation of the central substituentslocated in each isophthalaldehyde residue between two imine units.This is because the central directing groups provide hydrogen bondingwith different modes to imine building blocks located on both sides.These intramolecular forces endow the imine units with speci ?cc o n -formations, each resembling and favoring a speci ?cc a g ep r o d u c tt h a tis produced selectively. To be speci ?c, in the case of OH substituentgroup whose proton is rather acidic, the two imine bonds are pre-organized in an exo-endo conformation, driven by two differenthydrogen bonds in the form of either CH ?Oo rO H ?N. Such con-formation favors the formation of a chiral [3 + 6] cage containingenantiomeric pure trans -CHDA residues. When the substituent groupcontains no acidic protons such as an alkoxyl unit, the two imine bondshave an exo-exoconformation driven by two identical hydrogen bondsnamely CH ?O. Such conformation favors the formation of achiral[2 + 4] cages containing racemic trans -CHDA building blocks as thepredominant product, implying the occurrence of social self-sorting.In the case of ester substituent group containing protons with modestacidity, both the exo-endo and exo-exoconformations are thermo-dynamically feasible. As a consequence, the self-assembly products aresurprisingly determined by the chirality of the trans -CHDA, namelythat enantiomeric pure and racemic trans -CHDA favor the [3 + 6] and[2 + 4] products respectively. Such preference results from a tendencythat the imine protons attempt to adopt the synconformation relativeto the adjacent axial methine protons in the CHDA residues, in order tominimize steric hindrance. Our fundamental understanding of pre-cisely controlling the thermodynamic stability of a target product byusing directing group to regulate the intramolecular forces, is thussigni?cantly improved. Such results help us to rule out the reliance ofcationic transition metal templates that might be highly toxic. Futureresearch includes self-assembly of cage molecules with larger cavitiesand water-solubility, so that these self-assembled hosts are employedfor applications in some more challenging arenas, such as mimickingenzyme79¨C82in arti ?cial systems.",topology
