"←RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe recently reported a family of chiral cage molecules with atriangular prism shape (the topology can be denoted Tet 33Di6,according to our recently introduced nomenclature),21referredto here as TCC1 [3+6], TCC2 [3+6], and TCC3 [3+6](Figure S1 ).22The smallest cage in this family, TCC1 [3+6], was shapepersistent and found to have an apparent BET surface area(SABET) of 2037 m2g?1as a homochiral crystalline material. Ina subsequent crystallization screen for TCC1[3+6], we observeda new crystal habit for this system. Crystallization of TCC1 [3+6]from a chloroform solution containing ethanol or methanol asan antisolvent a ?orded a mixture of acicular or needle-likecrystals, along with the previously observed crystals ofTCC1[3+6], which are cubes. The needles were found to besingle, although some non-merohedral twinning was observed.",surface area

"←INTRODUCTIONPorous organic cages (POCs) are discrete, shape-persistentmolecules that possess an intrinsic void, which is accessible viawindows in the cage.1In contrast to extended, bondedframework materials, such as metal ?organic frameworks(MOFs)2and covalent organic frameworks (COFs),3POCsare often soluble in common organic solvents, opening up anumber of processing options and applications.4?6The cagepacking in the solid state has a profound e ?ect on theirproperties, and this can be controlled by the size and shape ofthe cage, the functionality present on the outer molecularsurface, and the conditions under which the cage is isolatedfrom solvent.7,8For example, changing the crystallizationsolvent can result in multiple polymorphs for the same cagemolecule, each possessing di ?erent physical properties.9Theinherent solubility of POCs also opens up the possibility offorming cage cocrystals, which can possess tunable properties10and a ?ord access to unique crystal packings.11Typically, organic cages are synthesized from one or twoprecursors that are able to self-assemble: for example, theimine-based organic cage CC3-Ris synthesized by the reactionof four molecules of 1,3,5-triformylbenzene with six moleculesof (R,R)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine. The precise size and shape ofthe resulting cage is sensitive to the choice of starting materialand the position of the reactive groups with respect to oneanother,7,8and the assembly mode is not always intuitive. Forthis reason, we have developed computational strategies topredict the reaction outcome in silico .12,13For dynamicsystems,14reversible bond formation enables error correctionduring synthesis and can often a ?ord clean formation of thedesired cage. To synthesize cage molecules with di ?erentshapes or topologies, it is common to use precursors withdi?erent geometries.7,8It is relatively rare to see changes in cagegeometry and/or topology by simply changing the reactionconditions for the same starting materials. However, rearrange-ment of imine-based cages in solution to form alternativemolecular species is possible because of the dynamic nature ofthe imine bonds, which can allow equilibration of the reactionmixture in response to external stimuli. Hence, the productdistribution may be a ?ected by changes in the reactionconditions, such as temperatu re, concentration, solventcomposition, the presence of a catalyst, or the presence of atemplating species.15Warmuth demonstrated that solvent canhave a strong in ?uence on the outcome of the cage-formingreaction between tetraformylcavitand and ethylenediamine.16Simply switching the reaction solvent between chloroform,tetrahydrofuran, or dichloromethane prompted the formationof octahedral [6 + 12], tetrahedral [4 + 8], or squareantiprismatic [8 + 16] nanocages, respectively.16,17We alsoobserved that recrystallizing the tetrahedral [4 + 6] cage, CC1,from DCM with o-xylene led to the formation of thethermodynamic triply interlocked [8 + 12] catenated species.18By using TFA as a catalyst, it was possible to form the [8 + 12]catenane directly in the synthesis.18The ability to switch thestoichiometry of the cage products demonstrates that theenergetics of host-solvent interactions can be used to ?ne-tunethe outcome of a particular synthesis; this is similar to theampli ?cation e ?ect observed in dynamic combinatorial receptorlibraries.19,20Here we show that two distinct organic cages,TCC1 [3+6]andTCC1 [6+12], could be synthesized from the sameReceived: October 9, 2017Revised: April 5, 2018Published: April 6, 2018Articlepubs.acs.org/crystal Cite This: Cryst.

"Solvent molecules were extremely disordered in the large void,and it was necessary to use the SQUEEZE routine in PLATONduring re ?nement.24The structural di ?erence betweenTCC1 [3+6] and TCC1 [6+12] can be understood by examiningthe orientation of the biphenyl group with respect to thetriangular shaped window ( Figure 2 ,Table S1 ). In TCC1[3+6],the biphenyl units are aligned and perpendicular to thesewindows ( Figure 2 a), whereas in TCC1 [6+12], they are splayedout in a pyramidal shape to form the larger truncatedtetrahedron cage ( Figure 2 b).In the solvated crystal structure of TCC1[6+12], the cages packalong the c-axis in a window-to-window con ?guration, with thesmaller, triangular window inserted into the larger, hexagonalwindows ( Figure 3 a). These window-to-window interactionsform one dimensional chains throughout the crystal structure,although only along one axis ( Figure 3 b).",topology
"HPLC analysis of a TCC1 crystallization mixture, whichcontained both crystal habits, showed the presence of two mainpeaks, one of which showed the same retention time as thepure TCC1[3+6]cage ( Figure S6 and S7 ). The new peak, whichhad a longer retention time, was therefore assigned as aTCC1 [6+12] cage based on liquid chromatography massspectrometry (LCMS) ( Figure S8 ). Since crystallizationsstarting with TCC1 [3+6] failed to a ?ord a high conversion toTCC1[6+12], we attempted to optimize the reaction conditionsto favor the formation of the larger cage. The starting point forthe synthetic optimization was the reported procedure for theTCC1 [3+6]synthesis; characterization of this material by NMR,MS, HPLC, PXRD, and SEM gave no indication that theoriginal synthetic procedure a ?orded any TCC1 [6+12].",topology
"Twenty reactions designed to evaluate the e ?ects oftemperature, concentration, stoichiometry, and solvent compo-sition were performed in parallel ( Table S2 ). Although theoriginal synthetic procedure was performed in dichloro-methane,22we selected CHCl 3as the primary solvent becausethe original crystallization study that a ?orded TCC1[6+12] usedCHCl 3. The reactions were monitored by HPLC, whichshowed that in addition to the peaks corresponding toTCC1 [3+6] and TCC1 [6+12], a third, unidenti ?ed peak wasalso present in most reactions performed in CHCl 3(FigureS9?13). We were unable to obtain a de ?nitive mass ion for thispeak using LC-MS, and as such, we could not determinewhether this third peak represents another cage possessing adi?erent stoichiometry or an intermediate in the cagerearrangement.",topology

Growth Des. 2018, 18, 2759 ?27642761There was no substantial increase in the proportion ofTCC1 [6+12] in CHCl 3; because of this, and the thirdunidenti ?ed peak in the HPLC, the reactions were repeatedin DCM ( Table S3 ). HPLC revealed that the use of DCM asthe primary solvent a ?orded better conversion to the large cagewhile suppressing the formation of the unidenti ?ed peak(Figure S14 ?17). There appears to be a general trend that themore polar the cosolvent, the greater the conversion to the bigcage ( Table S4 ). The conditions that most favored formation ofthe large cage were elevated temperatures with no acid catalyst,a slight excess of the diamine reagent (which often improvesreproducibility and overall conversion to the cage product),25and low reaction concentrations around 1 mg mL?1. Our bestconditions (1:1 DCM/MeOH, re ?ux, 5 days, 1 mg/mL, nocatalyst) a ?orded TCC1[6+12] with a peak area of 72% by HPLC(Figures S17 ). By comparison, the original published synthesisforTCC1 [3+6]22used an acid catalyst and a more concentratedreaction mixture, and it was performed at room temperature.Isolation of TCC1[6+12] was attempted using preparative HPLCand antisolvent precipitation, but both proved ine ?ective. Thismight be due to re-equilibration of the mixture when thesolvent composition is changed or decomposition ofTCC1[6+12] upon desolvation 牯we believe that the latter ismore likely because we were unable to fully dissolve thematerial after solutions containing TCC1[6+12] were evaporatedto dryness.To try to rationalize the formation of TCC1 [6+12] ,calculations were performed to compare the relative formationenergies of the [6 + 12] cages with the parent [3 + 6] cages,TCC1?3. To determine the lowest energy conformer for eachTCC1?3[6+12] structure, the molecules were analyzed in the gasphase using high temperature molecular dynamics (MD)combined with the OPLS3 force ?eld.",topology
"26The simulationswere run for 100 ns at 1000 K, with a time step of 1 fs, sampling10000 structures in an NVT ensemble. The simulations wererepeated until no new lower energy conformers were generated.The results showed that TCC1[6+12] partially collapses (A, tealstructure), while TCC2 [6+12] remains shape persistent with anopen internal cavity (B), and TCC3[6+12] collapses completelywith loss of the internal void (C, teal structure) ( Figure 4 ).",topology
"Nonetheless, it was possible to locate higher energy openconformers for both collapsed structures (A and C, graystructures) and to compare their relative energies with theircollapsed equivalents. More thorough energetic and geometricre?nements were carried out with density functional theory(DFT) methods on all structures to understand their relativestability. Calculations were performed with CP2K software27onboth open and collapsed conformers of all TCC [6+12]molecules, using the PBE functional28combined with theTZVP MOLOPT basis set29and D3 Grimme dispersioncorrection.

Growth Des. 2018, 18, 2759 ?27642762The open conformer of the large cage, TCC1 [6+12], wasfound to be 33 kJ mol?1higher in energy than its partiallycollapsed equivalent; therefore, it can be expected that thismolecule would collapse and lose its internal cavity in theabsence of solvent. The molecule is likely to collapse via avertex-folding mechanism, similar to that postulated for CC7;31TCC1[6+12] contains 12 cyclohexyldiamines, each of whichcould potentially rotate toward the cavity upon desolvation,thus generating disorder in the crystal structure and asubsequent decrease in porosity. The open conformer ofTCC3[6+12] was found to be 96 kJ mol?1higher in energy thanits completely collapsed conformer. Due to the presence ofsolvent in the reaction, these cages will most likely assemble astheir open conformers; hence, we choose to compare theinternal energies of the open TCC1?3[6+12] conformers withthose of the experimental and simulated TCC1 ?3[3+6]conformers.32A set of experimental solvated and desolvated crystalstructures were available for all three TCC1?3[3+6]molecules,as well as a set of manually constructed molecules for which wecarried out a geometry optimization using DFT. For TCC1[3+6],there was little structural di ?erence between these threeconformations and, consequentially, their relative energieswere similar, but this is not the case for TCC2 and TCC3(Figure 5 ). Our gas phase simulations do not include eithersolvent or crystal packing e ?ects; hence, we do not observe the※swelling §that is seen experimentally in the solvated crystalstructures of TCC2[3+6] and TCC3 [3+6]. Both the simulatedTCC1 [3+6]andTCC2 [3+6]structures overlay quite well with thedesolvated molecules, with RMSD values of 0.20 and 0.31 ?,respectively. However, the structure of simulated TCC3[3+6]twists in a way that is not observed in either the desolvated orsolvated crystal structures, and it therefore has much poorerRMSDs of 1.98 ? (desolvated) and 3.76 ? (solvated). Weattribute this to the absence of crystal packing interactions inour molecular simulations.",topology
"We next compared the relative energies of open TCC1?3[6+12] andTCC1?3[3+6](simulated and experimental solvatedand desolvated crystal structures) normalized per [3 + 6]stoichiometric unit (the [6 + 12] cages being exactly twice thesize of the [3 + 6] molecule). For all three systems, thesecalculations suggested preferential formation of the smaller [3 +6] cages22(Figure 5 ). For TCC1 , there is only a relatively smallenergetic di ?erence between the internal relative energy of the[3 + 6] cages (solvated, desolvated, and simulated) and theopen [6 + 12] cage, of F10 kJ mol?1per [3 + 6] stoichiometricunit. The energy di ?erence between the open, solvated [6 +12] cage and the [3 + 6] could potentially be overcome bychanges in the reaction conditions, particularly solvent choice.17For TCC2 [6+12], the larger molecule is considerably lessenergetically favorable than TCC2 [3+6] by between 29 and 42kJ mol?1, for the desolvated, solvated, and simulated structures.",topology
"The situation for the TCC3 molecule is more complicatedbecause there is a large variation in relative energies betweenthe di ?erent conformations. If only the desolvated andsimulated conformations are considered, then there is a largepreference for TCC[3+6] to form by 23 and 45 kJ mol?1,respectively. However, the solvated SCXRD conformation forTCC3[3+6] is only 2 kJ mol?1more stable than the openTCC3 [6+12], which we attribute to the signi ?cant strain that isvisible in the solvated TCC3 [3+6] conformation ( Figure 5 ).",topology
"Taken together, these calculated energy di ?erences canrationalize why TCC1 [6+12] was observed experimentallyunder certain conditions whereas the equivalent [6 + 12]analogues of TCC2 [3+6]andTCC3 [3+6]were not.←CONCLUSIONSA new imine cage was isolated by a solvent mediated re-equilibration of a triangular prismatic [3 + 6] shaped cage to a[6 + 12] truncated tetrahedron shaped cage. Of the three cagesin the TCC series, only TCC1 was found to re-equilibrate inthis way. This was rationalized by molecular modeling, whichalso predicted that the large cage is not shape persistent andwould be expected to partially collapse on desolvation. Whilethe collapsed TCC1[6+12] cage was predicted to be lower inenergy than TCC1 [3+6], the open, solvated TCC1 [6+12] cage waspredicted to be higher in energy. Our inability to cleanly isolateTCC1[6+12] suggests that the di ?erence in energy between thelarge and small cages is small. These ?ndings emphasize thatsubtle changes in crystallization or reaction conditions can havea pronounced e ?ect on the structure of POCs synthesized byreversible bond forming reactions. The results also highlight theimportance of characterizing the reaction products by morethan SCXRD alone.",topology

From top to bottom 每 i) peak at ~3.9 min: calc. for TCC1 [3+6] C90H90N12 1339.7443, found [M+2H]2+ 670.8793; ii) peak at ~5.5 min: calc. for TCC1 [6+12] C180H180N24 2679.4885, found C 180H180N24 + H 2O (calc. 2697.7991) [M+2H]2+ 1349.7485. The large amount of TCC1 [3+6] observed in the peak at ~5.5 mins is thought to be due to fragmentation of the larger TCC1 [6+12] 每 attempted runs using milder ionisation conditions, and optimisation of the fragmentor and capill ary voltage to favour the larger cage, showed no improvement.",topology
"5 Optimisation of Synthesis  Optimisation of the synthesis was based on the original reported synthesis  of TCC1 [3+6] from literature ;6 the original  synthesis was found to only afford the smaller [3+6] cage.  The large [6+12 ] cage was found from recrystallization experiments, however we were unable to isolate  a significant quantity of the  cage through crystallisation  as the smaller [3+6] was usually the dominant product . In order to increase the yield of the [6+12]  cage we screen ed a range of reaction conditions aimed at isolating the large cage directly from synthesis.  The solvents  dichloromethane and chloroform  were ch osen as the primary solvents as the organic cages are generally soluble in these  solvents.  Chloroform was investigated first as the large cage crystallised from a mixture containing chloroform and methanol.",topology

"TCC1 [6+12] The following method generated a ratio of 7:1 large cage:small cag e (by % a/a, HPLC, 254 nm), based on a modification  of the already published method.6 A solution of 5,5' -(ethyne -1,2-diyl)diisophthalaldehyde (0.520 g, 1.791 mmol) and S,S-(+)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane (0.468 g, 4.098 mmol) in a mixed solvent system  of 1:1 dichloromethane/methanol (1000 mL) was heated under reflux for 5 days with stirring. After cooling, the solution was concentrated to ~50 mL at 25 °C under reduced pressure. A small amount of precipitate formed in the solution (< 20 mg) which was fi ltered post vac, and the remaining solution was filtered with a syringe filter to ensure clarity, and was found to contain a mixture of 7:1 large cage to small cage.
