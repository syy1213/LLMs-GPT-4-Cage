Proton nuclear magnetic resonance(1H NMR) spectra of POC samples were recored on an AVANCE 400(400 MHz) spectrometer from Burker at room temperature(RT). Mass spectra(MS) were performed on an Bruker Impact II UHR-TOF mass spectrometry with an ESI-L low concentration tuning mix as the internal standard at RT. Data analyses and simulations of MS spectra were processed on a Bruker Data Analysis software (Version 4.3). Fourier transform infrared(FTIR) spectra  (4000〞400 cm?1) were measured on a Magna 750 FTIR spectrometer at RT using KBr pellets. Thermal gravimetric analysis(TGA) curves were carried out on a NETZSCH STA 449C thermal analyzer by heating samples from 30 ∼C to 900 ∼C under a nitrogen(N2) flow. Powder X-ray diffraction(PXRD) patterns were measured at RT by a Mini 600 X-ray diffractometer from Rigaku. N2, carbon dioxide(CO 2) and methane(CH 4) gas adsorption-desorption isotherms of POCs were measured by a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 surface     area and porosity analyzer. Before adsorption tests, POC samples were degassed at 120 ∼C in the analysis chamber under vacuum of 10每5 bar(1 bar=105 Pa) for 10 h. Column breakthrough experiments of CO 2/CH 4(1:1, volume ratio)  were measured under ambient conditions using a home-built setup coupled with a Pfeiffer GSD320 mass spectrometer. Before measuring, POC samples were heated at 100 ∼C with a c o n s t a n t  f l o w  o f  H e ( 1 0  m L / m i n ) ,  t h e n  c h a n g e d  t o  C O2/CH 4  gas flow(3 mL/min). Outlet effluent from the column was continuously monitored every 3 s on an MS spectrometer.  The complete breakthrough of CO2 and CH 4 was determined using a downstream gas composit ion reaching that of the  feed gas.",affiliation

"2.2 Synthesis of CPOCs CPOCs-105: 81 mg(0.1 mmol) of  C4RACHO was dissolved in 16 mL of hot CHCl 3 in a 48 mL pressure vial, then a solution of 27 mg(0.2 mmol) of p-XDA in 4 mL of chloroform(CHCl 3) was slowly introduced. After sealing the obtained mixture, it was stirred at 65 ∼C for 6 h. Upon cooling to ambient temperature, the mixture was divided into 4 parts by a 20 mL glass vial, then a chlorobenzene(1.5 mL) solvent was introduced, followed by slow vapor diffusion of MeOH into the abovementioned mixture for 7 d. The resulting CPOC-105 with red block single crystals was subjected to washing using MeOH, affording a yield of  ca. 79%.",comprehensive synthesis

"In the last decade, POC＊s Brunauer-Emmett-Teller(BET) surface areas have increased from the initial 624 m2/g up to 3758 m2/g[25,26], and show ability to storage H 2, CO 2, hydrocarbons, and so on[27〞29] . As for gas separation applications, although POC materials have shown good selectivity for gas mixtures, such as CO 2/N 2, CO 2/CH 4, C2H2/CO 2, C2 hydrocarbons based on the theory calculation via correlating pure component adsorption isotherms[30〞33] , only high similar C 2H2/CO 2, rare gas Xe/Kr, greenhouse SF 6/N 2, H2/D 2 isotope, and industrially important C2 and C3 hydrocarbons separation have been confirmed by mixed gas experiments to our best of knowledge[34〞38] . Compared to the COF and metal-organic framework(MOF) materials for gas separation  applications[39〞41] , the POC materials are still in their initial stage, and thus there is much room for developing new POCs and exploring their application in this region. Calix[4]resorcinarenes(abbreviate d as C4RAs), a subclass of calixarenes, are macrocyclic molecule with intrinsic cavities, and have been documented as good candidates to construct supramolecular cages, metal-organic cages and covalent organic cages[42〞44] . Our group[45〞54]  are particularly interested in preparing new RC4A-based porous materials, especially for the POCs, as well as their practical applications. More than 20 RC4A-based POCs with structural diversity from lanterns, triangular prisms, square pr isms to octahedra based on concave-shaped tetraformyl-functionalized C4RA(C4RACHO, Fig.1) OBB and diamine and dihydrazide linkers have been synthesized by our group[52,53] very recently. These POCs exhibit good capacities for H 2, CO 2 and C2 hydrocarbons adsorption, and some of them are capable to separate C2H2/CO 2 and C 2H6/C2H4[34,35]. As an extension of our work, we have tried to expand the C4RA-based POC family and also their applications by using other linkers with di- or multiple amine groups. In this paper, two new POCs constructed from C4RACHO and flexible xylylenediamine(XDA) isomers(Fig.1) are synthesized. Herein, the synthesis, characterization and CO2/CH 4 separation of the aforementioned POCs are presented and discussed.",surface area
"As shown in Fig.2(A), the CO 2 adsorption isotherms of both POC materials exhibit pseudotype I isotherms with saturated uptake of 131 and 115 cm3/g at 196 K and under 1.01℅105 Pa for CPOC-105 and CPOC-106, respectively. The corresponding BET surface areas based on the abovementioned CO 2 adsorption isotherms are 277 and 218 m2/g. It should be noted that cavitand-based organic cages are often able to encapsulate specific gases, such as hydrocarbons and CO2 by host-guest interactions for the nature of intrinsic cavity. Thus, CH 4 and CO 2 gas sorption by CPOC-105 and CPOC-106 were performed, because separation and recovery of CO 2 from flue gas and natural gas are important in view of environmental and energy point in recent years. As can be seen from Fig.2(B), both CPOC-105 and CPOC-106 show an obviously preferential adsorption of CO2 over CH 4 at 298 K and under 1.01℅105 Pa. Specifically, the adsorption capacities of CO 2 and CH 4 for desolvated CPOC-105 and CPOC-106 are up to 44/37 and 17/20 cm3/g, respectively. In order to calc ulate the isosteric heat of adsorption( Qst), their CH 4 and CO 2 gas sorptions at 273 K and under 1.01℅105 Pa were also been measured, which show   the same trend in comparison to the adsorption isotherms at 298 K(Fig.S14, see the Electronic Supplementary Material of this paper). The Qst values for CO 2 and CH 4 based on the adsorption isotherms at 273 and 298 K were fitted by the virial equation, and the calculated Q st values are 23.4/27.2 and 19.9/17.9 kJ/mol for CPOC-105 and CPOC-106 at zero coverage(Figs.S15〞Fig.S24, see the Electronic Supplementary Material of this paper), respectively. The ideal adsorbed solution theory(IAST) was applied to evaluate the adsorption selectivity of CPOC-105 and CPOC-106 at 298 K and under 1.01℅105 Pa. As indicated in Fig.2(C), the CO 2/CH 4 selectivity of CPOC-105 is up to 3.2 under low pressure and at 298 K for equimolecular CO2/CH 4 gas mixture, which is higher than that of CPOC-106 with a value of 2.1. With the increase of pressure, the selectivity values gradually increase up to 4.5 and 3.1 under 1.01℅105 Pa for CPOC-105 and CPOC-106, respectively.",surface area

In this work, two novel [2+4] organic cages with distinguished structures have been prepared based on the Schiff-based condensation reaction between tetraformyl-functionalized calix[4]resorcinarene building blocks and xylylenediamine(XDA) isomers. Specifically, the use of para -position XDA affords lantern-shaped cage(CPOC-105) with a medium cavity of ca. 0.526 nm3, while the meta -position produces peanut-shaped structure(CPOC-106) with two small cavities of ca. 0.181 nm3. Both CPOC-105 and CPOC-106 exhibit high selectivity capture of CO 2 over CH 4 with calculated selectivity coefficients of 4.5 and 3.1, respectively, under ambient conditions, and are capable of separating CO 2/CH 4 mixtures by fixed-bed column breakthrough experiments.",this paper's author

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiment reveals that CPOC-105 crystallizes in th e monoclinic space group P21/c, its asymmetric unit contains a [2+4] organic cage and an inside chlorobenzene molecule(Fig.1 and Fig.S1, see the Electronic Supplementary Material of this paper). This cage has one central lantern-shaped cavity and four quadrilateral windows.",topology
"The overall geometry of CPOC-105 is similar to our recently reported [2+4] cages, constr ucted from two C4RACHO units and four ?exible alkanediamine linkers[52]. The calculated cavity volume of CPOC-105 is 0.526 nm3 by Voidoo[58]. Using m-XDA in place of p-XDA that was used in the synthesis of abovementioned cage affords CPOC-106. Notably, the XDA＊s angle has a big influence on the resulting cage topology. Unlike the lantern-shaped CPOC-105, single-crystal X-ray diffraction suggests that CPOC-106 is a rare [2+4] peanut-shaped structure(Fig.1). It belongs to the space group P21/c within monoclinic crystal system, and comprises a whole cage, an m-dichlorobenzene, and three CHCl3 molecules in its asymmetric unit(Fig.S2, see the Electronic Supplementary Material of this paper). Two CHCl 3 molecules locate in the cavity of CPOC-106, and the rest CHCl 3 and m-dichlorobenzene molecules are around the cage. CPOC-106 contains two small cavities with each volume of 0.181 nm3, which is determined by Voidoo, as the central channel of this cage is not able to pass a molecu le with a radius of 0.14 nm. In addition, thermal gravimetric experiments of both cages indicate high thermal stability with decomposition temperature more than 300 oC(Fig.S3 and Fig.S4, see the Electronic Supplementary Material of this paper). Notably, both samples lost their crystalline and transformed into amorphous state after desolvating in high vacuum(Figs.S5 and Fig.S6, see the Electronic Suppl ementary Material of this paper). However, the 1H NMR, FTIR, together with MS spectra of the desolvated CPOC-105 and CPOC-106 samples highly reveal the cage architectures of both desolvated samples are intact(Fig.S7〞Fig.S12, see the Electronic Supplementary Material of this paper). As can be seen from the 1H NMR and FTIR spectra, it is obvious that the imine bonds in both cages transfer to amine bonds through keto-enamine tautomerization, which have also been observed in our previous reported C4RA-based POCs[52].",topology
