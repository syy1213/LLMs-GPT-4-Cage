"Data processing and absorption correction (SADABS)[S4] were accomplished by standard methods. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full -matrix least -squares using SHELXL software.[S5] All non -hydrogen atoms were refined using anisotropic thermal parameters; hydrogen atoms were treated using appropriate riding models. The crystallographic informat ion file s (CCDC -1839251  [3]; CCDC -1839252 [ 5]; CCDC -1839253 [ 9]; CCDC -1839254 [ 10]) have been deposited in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre and can be downloaded free of charge via www.ccdc.camac.uk/data_request/cif.ls. Gassorption Experiments: T he surface areas and porosities were characterized by nitrogen adsorption and desorption analysis at 77.35 K with an autosorb computer controlled surface analyzer (AUTOSORB -iQ2, Quantachrome). The activation methods are listed below. The Brunauer -Emmett -Teller (BET) surface areas were calculated assuming a cross sectional area of 0.162 nm2 for the nitrogen molecules in the pressure range P/P 0 = 0.01 -0.1. Pressure range that have a positive slope in the Rouquerol plot  were taken into account. The non -local density functional theory (NLDFT model) and isotherm data were used to calculate the pore size distribution.",CCDC
