Thismolecular-cage-based amorphous material exhibited exceptionaladsorption selectivity (138/1) for CO2over N 2under ambientconditions (20/C14C, 1 bar).26This selectivity is superior to manyporous networks, although the adsorption capacity is signi?-cantly lower than those network materials.

"There has been growing interest in purely organic porous mate-rials in the last decade. They include crystalline covalent organicframeworks (COF),1每6amorphous porous organic polymers(POP)7每17and porous organic molecules.18每26These low-densityorganic materials have rapidly emerged as promising candidatesfor gas storage/separation and catalysis. Brunauer每Emmett每Teller (BET) surface area ( SBET) of up to 4210 m2g/C01has beenreported for COF-103.2Very recently, a crystalline organic cagehas been reported to exhibit an impressive SBETof 1375 m2g/C01,24surpassing many amorphous organic polymers, such as polymersof intrinsic microporosity (PIMs),10,11conjugated microporouspolymers (CMPs)12,13or hypercross-linked polymers (HCPs).27However, in general, discrete organic molecules possess consid-erably lower surface areas than COFs and polymer networks.",surface area
"32 The BET surface area was measured at 77 K with krypton usingAutosorb iQ Station 2 and frameworks F1每F3 and cage-1 exhibita surface area of <1 m2g/C01. The low surface area can be attributed,at least partially, to the presence of ?exible amino groups (每CH 2每NH每), which allows the cage top and bottom panels to twist withrespect to each other, thus signi?cantly decreasing the inner-cagepore volume.",surface area

Materials and general methods         Reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification, unless otherwise indicated. Tetrahydrofuran is purified by MBRAUN solvent purification systems. Linkers L1, L2, and L3 are prepared as reported in the literature.1,2,3        All microwave reactions were conducted under dry nitrogen in oven-dried glass tube using Discover SP microwave from CEM.        Solid state 13C NMR spectra were taken on Inova 400 spectrometers.        For TGA analyses, samples were run on a TA Instruments Q-500 series thermal gravimetric analyzer with samples held in a platinum pan under nitrogen atmosphere, and a 10 K min-1 ramp rate was used.           Powder X-ray-diffraction (XRD) profiles were obtained with an Inel CPS 120 diffraction system, using monochromated Cu K(alpha) radiation. All XRD spectra were calibrated against silver behenate as a diffraction standard (d100 = 58 ?), so the accuracy is within 1 ? up to the value of the d-spacings. XRD measurements were all performed at ambient temperature (21 ㊣ 1 ∼C).      SEM images were recorded using a JSM-6480LV (LVSEM) at 5.0 kV.  Sample was sputter-coated with gold prior to analysis.  2. Procedures Cage framework F1: To a glass tube were added Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (5 mg, 0.007 mmol), CuI (0.5 mg, 0.002 mmol), a solution of cage 1 (125 mg, 0.038 mmol) and 1,4-diethynylbenzene (14 mg, 0.114 mmol) in THF (2 mL), and piperidine (1 mL). The mixture was degassed by evacuating and refilling with nitrogen three times. The yellow solution was then heated at 100 oC for 1 h using microwave irradiation. The mixture was cooled to 60 oC and the red gel-like material was separated from yellow suspension by decantation. The red-gel was crushed into small pieces, and THF (10 mL) was added. After irradiation at 85 oC with microwave for 10 min, the solid material was filtered. The above procedure was repeated (~6 times) to wash the red-gel-like materials until the solution phase became colorless. The product was dried under high vacuum to obtain a red solid (121 mg, 90 %). Cage framework F2: The above microwave assisted synthetic procedure for framework F1 was followed. Using Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (4.5 mg, 0.006 mmol), CuI (0.4 mg, 0.002 mmol), cage 1 (118 mg, 0.036 mmol), linker L2 (24 mg, 0.107 mmol), THF (2 mL), and piperidine (1 mL), the framework F2 (110 mg, 74 %) was obtained as a red solid. Cage framework F3: The above microwave assisted synthetic procedure for framework F1 was followed.
