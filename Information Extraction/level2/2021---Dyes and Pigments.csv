In this work, two [3 ?2] imine organic cages (1 and 2) stemmed from distinct TPE-based dialdehydes (TPE-2CHO/TPE-2PCHO) and common tri (2-aminoethyl)amine were obtained. Both of them are fluorescence silence in solution and high-efficient AIE could be observed, which is different from all known TPE-based organic cages with AIEE properties. Because of the cage skeleton encircled by multiple benzene rings, the two cages can effectively detect various explosives including nitrobenzene, 2-nitrotoluene, 3-nitrotoluene, 4-nitrotoluene and 2,6-dinitrotoluene both in solution and in the solid state, in which cage 1 displays higher detection ability due to its nine encircling benzene donors   1.Introduction Nitro-aromatic compounds such as nitrobenzene (NB) and 2,6-dini -trotoluene (2,6-DNT) are widely used explosive materials, and they have brought considerable safety hazards. Therefore, the sensitive and accurate detection of explosives has always been a frontier research for scientists [1每3]. Nowadays, several analytical methods, such as trained canine teams, ion mobility spectrometry [4], gas chromatography [5] and fluorescence quenching [6每12], have been utilized for the effective detection of explosives. Among them, the fluorescence quenching has drawn much more attention due to its unique advantages, such as high sensitivity, rapid response time and low cost. However, traditional fluorescent materials often suffer from the obnoxious aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect when aggregation occurs, which extremely limits their practical detection values. In this sense, molecules with AIE property can solve this problem well owing to their strong fluorescence emission in the aqueous phase [13每15].",affiliation
"Nevertheless, locking the TPE structure into a rigid skeleton has greatly inhibited the intramolecular rotation and vibration. As a result, all these formed cages emitted fluorescence both in the aggregated state and in solution, and these cages exhibited aggregation-induced emission enhancement (AIEE) behavior. Actually, it is still meaningful and chal-lenging to develop new TPE-based organic cages keeping the basic character of TPE (no fluorescence in solution) and realizing high-efficient AIE instead of AIEE. It is well-known that the benzene rings of TPE can consume energy through the free rotation, which is the decisive factor for its non-fluorescence in dilute solution. Considering that all four benzene rings of TPE-based monomers in previously re-ported organic cages are tightly fixed, is it possible to leave some ben-zene rings of the TPE moiety free during the self-assembly of the cages, *Corresponding author.
