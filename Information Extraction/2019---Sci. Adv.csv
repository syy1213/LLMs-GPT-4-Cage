"Guest protection within cage cavityWithin the cavity of 36+, the guests are isolated from the bulk envi -ronment, which prevents them from reacting with other substrates in the bulk solutions (Fig.?3A). For example, combining an electron-  deficient alkyne 4 (69 mg) and anthracene (0.43 mg) in MeCN (0.6?ml) led to the formation of a Diels-Alder adduct 5, after heating the solution at 80∼C for 74 hours. The pseudo每first-order rate constant kobs was determined to be 0.024?s?1 (Fig.?3B, black plot) by using 1H NMR spectroscopy. As a comparison, after encapsulating within the cavity of the cage 36+, the rate of Diels-Alder reaction was signifi -cantly decreased. kobs was measured to be 0.0029?s?1 (Fig.?3B, red plot), nearly one order of magnitude smaller than that in the absence of the host. Addition of a competitive guest, namely, pyrene, into the solution of anthracene ? 36+?6PF 6? could release anthracene into the bulk solution and turn on the Diels-Alder reaction. In this condi -tion, kobs was measured to be 0.014?s?1 (Fig.?3B, blue plot).",comprehensive synthesis
