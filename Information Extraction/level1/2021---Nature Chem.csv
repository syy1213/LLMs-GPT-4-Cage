The industrial separation of C 2H4from ethane(C2H6) is typically through cryogenic distillation at high pressureand very low temperature, using very high towers, because theyhave similar sizes and volatilities2. Such a process is highly energyconsuming, and thus exploring of other effective C 2H4separationmethods at ambient conditions is highly demanded. Selectiveadsorption by porous materials for producing high-purity C 2H4has been determined to be one of the most desired methods for itslow energy consumption3,4. Of particular recent interest in thisregard is using C 2H6-selective porous materials enriched withnonpolar/inert surfaces (e.g., introducing aromatic or aliphaticentities), because they prefer to capture more polarizable C 2H6,and thus can directly afford high-purity C 2H4in a singleadsorption step, avoiding an additional high-energy-consumingdesorption step5,6. So far, most of the developed C 2H6-selectiveadsorbents are metal-containing materials6每10. However, thepolar metal centers in these materials can interact with unsatu-rated C 2H4molecules via strong 羽-complexation interactions, andthus weaken their C 2H6/C2H4separation abilities11. Therefore,developing other C 2H6-selective adsorbents such as metal-freeorganic porous materials is highly required12,13, because theycannot only avoid the abovementioned problem, but also areeasier to construct inert surfaces. However, the research of suchmaterials is still in its initial stage14,15.",affiliation

"Synthetic procedure . All reagents and solvents were supplied by SinopharmChemical Reagent Co., Ltd with analytical grade, and utilized without furtherpuri?cation. CPOC-301 was synthesized as follows57: 162 mg (0.20 mmol)RC4ACHO63and 43 mg (0.4 mmol) p-phenylenediamine were added into 5 mLnitrobenzene and 15 mL CHCl 3. After sealing the mixture in a 48 mL pressure vial,heating to 65 ∼C with stirring for 2 days, and cooling down naturally. Red blocksingle crystals of CPOC-301 with ~78% yield were obtained by slow methanolvapor diffusion into the above mixture.",comprehensive synthesis
"Porous organic cages (POCs), as a type of porous materials, areintrinsically porous given their hollow cavities16每21. The discreteinherent nature of POCs makes them possessing distinct bene ?tsin solution processing, regeneration as well as post-synthesismodi ?cation21每24. Following the ?rst elegant research reported in2009 by Cooper et al.25, the number of POCs with differentshapes, sizes and properties has increased substantially26每36, butrobust POCs with high surface areas are still few, which highlyhinder their practical use in gas storage as well as separation.Over the past decade, although Brunauer 每Emmett 每Teller (BET)surface areas of POCs have increased from the initial 624 to 3758m2g每1, most of POCs have BET values <1000 m2/g37,38. As forbinary gas mixture separation, Cooper et al. ?rst reported thatimine-linked tetrahedral POC (CC3) exhibits selectivity of 20.4for noble gas Xe/Kr separations at low concentrations in 201439.",surface area
"Gas adsorption and separation performances . The channel-typestructure of CPOC-301 can potentially lead to interesting solid-state gas sorption properties. The permanent porosity of theactivated CPOC-301 was con ?rmed by N 2gas sorption experi-ments at 77 K (Fig. 2). Its N 2adsorption isotherm shows a typicaltype I curve with a small fraction of a type IV adsorptionbehavior. The maximum N 2adsorption is 670 cm3g?1, and thecalculated BET of CPOC-301 is up to 1962 m2g?1. The porevolume as well as the micropore volume of CPOC-301 respec-tively reach 1.03 and 0.46 cm3g?1. The pore size distribution(PSD) pro ?le exhibits a relatively sharp distribution of micro-pores from 1.59 to 1.77 nm (Fig. 2inset), consistent with thecavity size of CPOC-301 in the crystal structure.",surface area
"ARTICLEEf?cient ethylene puri ?cation by a robustethane-trapping porous organic cageKongzhao Su1,2,4, Wenjing Wang1,4, Shunfu Du1,3, Chunqing Ji1,2& Daqiang Yuan1,2?The removal of ethane (C 2H6) from its analogous ethylene (C 2H4) is of paramountimportance in the petrochemical industry, but highly challenging due to their similarphysicochemical properties. The use of emerging porous organic cage (POC) materials forC2H6/C2H4separation is still in its infancy. Here, we report the benchmark example of atruncated octahedral calix[4]resorcinarene-based POC adsorbent (CPOC-301), preferring toadsorb C2H6than C 2H4, and thus can be used as a robust absorbent to directly separatehigh-purity C 2H4from the C 2H6/C2H4mixture. Molecular modelling studies suggest theexceptional C 2H6selectivity is due to the suitable resorcin[4]arene cavities in CPOC-301,which form more multiple C 每H﹞﹞﹞羽hydrogen bonds with C 2H6than with C 2H4guests. Thiswork provides a fresh avenue to utilize POC materials for highly selective separation ofindustrially important hydrocarbons.https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24042-7 OPEN1State Key Laboratory of Structural Chemistry, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.",this paper's author

"Calix[4]resorcinarenes, a subset of calixarenes, were derivedfrom acid-catalyzed condensation between resorcinol and variouskinds of aldehydes43每45. They possess electron-rich 羽cavitiesand eight upper-rim phenolic groups, and are effective hostsfor inclusion of various guests ranging from small gases tolarge organic molecules45每49. Notably, their upper rims can beeasily functionalized, making them good molecular buildingblocks for constructing self-assembled cages as well as porouspolymers50每56. Very recently, our group employed predesignedconcave-shaped tetraformylresorcin[4]arene (RC4ACHO) assecondary building blocks and different diamines as linkers tosystematically design and synthesize several porous POCs withstructural diversity from [2 +4] dimeric lanterns, [3 +6] trimerictriangular prisms, to [6 +12] hexameric octahedra57. However,utilizing calix[4]resorcinarene-based POCs as solid adsorbents forgas separation applications remains unexploited. Herein, wepresent that the robust and highly porous [6 +12] octahedralcalix[4]resorcinarene-based POC (CPOC-301) is an excellentC2H6-selective material, and can be used as a robust absorbent todirectly afford high-purity C 2H4from C 2H6/C2H4mixture.",topology
"Motivated by the high uptake capacity and C 2H6-selectivebehavior of CPOC-301, the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST)is used to assess its separation selectivity for C 2H6/C2H4(50:50)(Supplementary Figs. 11 每13). IAST calculation results demon-strate that C 2H6/C2H4selectivity range is from 1.3 to 1.4 at 293 K.Compared to other C 2H6-selective porous organic molecularmaterials, the selectivity value of C 2H6over C 2H4for CPOC-301is comparable to [4 +6] boronic ester cage (1.29) reported byMastalerz et al.58, but lower than the recently reported hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks including HOF-76 (2.0)14and ZJU-HOF-1 (2.25) reported by Li and Chen (Supplementary Fig. 14)15.",topology
