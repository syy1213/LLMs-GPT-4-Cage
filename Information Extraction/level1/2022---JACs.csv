"9목Single crystal crystallography. Crystallographical data of BPPOC was collected on a diffractometer of SuperNova, Dual, Cu at home/near, AtlasS2 with Cu K붸 radiation (뷂 = 1.54184 ?) at 150.00 K. The structure was solved by the direct method (SHELXS-2014) and refined by full-matrix least-squares (SHELXL-2014) on F2.S1a,S1b Anisotropic thermal parameters were used for the non-hydrogen atoms and isotropic parameters for the hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen atoms were added geometrically and refined using a riding model. Crystallographic and refinement parameters for organic cages are compiled in Table S1. Because there are seriously disordered solvent molecules in the cage pores, 몵SQUEEZE몶 command was employed. CCDC 2143974 for BPPOC contain the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper. These data can be obtained free of charge from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif.S5Iodine vapor uptake and recycling  experiments . Time-dependent  iodine  vapor  uptake  experiments  were  performed  using  the following  procedure:  The POCs  and COFs  samples  (10.0  mg) were  weighed  in a preweighed  glass  vessel  (5 mL) and then transferred  to a larger  sealed  glass  vial (50 mL) containing  800.0  mg iodine  at the bottom.  There  was not physical  contact  between  the iodine  and the samples.  Next,  the closed  container  was heated  at 75 뫢C in an oven.  After  iodine  vapor  adsorption,  the iodine-loaded  materials  were  cooled  to room  temperature  and weighed.  The iodine  uptake  capacities  were  calculated  using  the weight  gain:  C = (W a ? Wb)/W b g g?1, where  C is the iodine  uptake  capacity,  and Wa and Wb are the weight  of the materials  after  and before  iodine  vapor  adsorption,  respectively.  For adsorbent  recycling,  a portion  of iodine-equilibrium  powder  was heated  at 125 뫢C under  vacuum  for 4.0 h, affording  a regenerated  material  for cycling.",CCDC

"5목Synthesis of 1,1',1'',1'''-([2,2'-bithiophene]-4,4'-diylbis(benzene-5,1,3-triyl))tetrakis(N-cyclohexylmethanimine) (BDTC). A mixture of BTDDP (215.3 mg, 0.5 mmol), cyclohexylamine (218.2 mg, 2.2 mmol), trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (5.0 뷃L), and chloroform (125.0 mL) in a 250 mL flask was stirred at 55 oC.

Recrystallization of solid in dichloromethane and methanol led to the precipitation of white microcrystal, which was dried at room temperature, giving BDTC in the yield of 62% (235.2 mg). It is worth noting that BTDDP is insoluble in dichloromethane, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, and only sparingly soluble in DMSO.

"11목BPPOC displays very low N 2uptake at even 1.0 bar, giving alow Brunauer ?Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 52 m2g?1,Figure S23 . Instead, on the basis of CO 2adsorption data at196 K, Figure S24 , the BET surface area of BPPOC is 577 m2g?1, similar to that of BTPOC (605 m2g?1) under the sametest conditions.12Activated USTB-1 and USTB-2 degassed at100 뫢C show a type-I gas sorption curve at 77 K, Figure 3 ,indicating the microporous characteristics of these twomaterials. The BET surface areas were calculated to be 1322m2g?1for USTB-1 and 322 m2g?1for USTB-2. The pore sizedistribution study reveals the dual-pore structure with the sizeof 1.88 and 2.18 nm for USTB-1 and 1.89 and 2.15 nm forUSTB-2, Figure 3 a?d. The values for both materials are quiteclose to the theoretical pore sizes of 1.84 and 2.02 nm,con?rming their same Kagome lattice nature.",surface area
"12목14The total porevolumes were calculated as 0.66 and 0.22 cm3g?1for USTB-1and USTB-2, respectively. For USTB-3, Figure 3 e, the verysmall BET surface area of 20 m2g?1might also be due to itspoor crystalline state, preventing us from ?tting the pore sizedistribution. As for the cage-derived COFs ranging fromUSTB-1c to USTB-4c, their BET surface areas weresigni?cantly enhanced to 1454, 365, 598, and 441 m2g?1,respectively. The pore sizes of USTB-1c and USTB-2c areoverall consistent with the theoretical values deduced from thepredesigned COF structures, Figure 3 b,d. This is also true forUSTB-3c (1.71 and 2.08 nm) and USTB-4c (1.81 and 2.04nm), Figure 3 f,h. At the end of this paragraph, it is noteworthythat the BET surface area of 193 m2g?1for USTB-4 뫣is smallerthan that of USTB-4c (441 m2g?1),Figure S25 , con?rming thein?uence of di ?erent starting materials on the preparation ofhigh-quality COFs.",surface area
"14목15?21A variety of adsorbents including MOFs,15COFs,16?18and POCs12,19?21have been disclosed to exhibithigh-e ?ciency iodine capture performance in comparison withcommercial zeolites and active carbons. In the present case, theisolated POCs and 2D COFs possessing well-de ?ned porousstructures in combination with their heteroatom-rich molecularmodule nature most probably endow them with good I2capture properties by forming charge-transfer species.12,18Asa consequence, the iodine vapor capture experiments wereperformed on two POCs and seven COFs at 348 K. BPPOCdisplays the iodine adsorption amount of 5.34 g g?1after 20 hand gets saturated with 5.64 g g?1after 50 h, Figure 4 a,b. Theiodine vapor adsorption capability of this cage is better thanthe POC benchmarks including OMC319(3.78 g g?1), BPy-Cage20(3.23 g g?1), and CC321(0.45 g g?1). However, thesulfur-rich cage BTPOC shows a much lower iodine vaporadsorption uptake of 3.21 g g?1than the nitrogen-richcounterpart BPPOC despite their similar BET surfaceareas,12revealing the nitrogen-rich superiority in iodinecapture. Actually, such a high iodine vapor adsorption behaviorof BPPOC surpasses the excellent organic adsorbates such asmolecular crystals,22conjugated microporous polymers,23andporous aromatic frameworks,24Figure 4 c and Table S4 .USTB-1 exhibits a moderately high iodine vapor captureuptake of 4.45 g g?1. The other two directly prepared dual-poreCOFs, USTB-2 and USTB-3, show slightly lower iodine vaporcapacities with the uptake of 4.38 and 3.14 g g?1, respectively,Figure 4 a. Their di ?erence in iodine vapor capacities might beattributed to the synergy e ?ect between the heteroatomcomponent and experimental pore volumes. Interestingly,cage-derived USTB-1c was revealed to display an enhancediodine vapor capacity of 5.80 g g?1in comparison with that ofUSTB-1 (4.45 g g?1). This is indeed also true for the increasediodine uptake of 4.57 and 3.30 g g?1for USTB-2c and USTB-3c, respectively, compared wi th their directly preparedcounterparts, due probably to the formation of more porositybetween cage-derived COF crystallites than the directlyprepared species according to the higher experimental N2uptake at 1 bar revealed by the adsorption curves. USTB-4cpossesses a moderate iodine adsorption amount of 3.02 g g?1.",surface area
"1목In the present case, the nitrogen-rich COFs, USTB-1 (1c) andUSTB-2 (2c), seem to exhibit higher iodine vapor uptakes thanthe corresponding sulfur-rich species USTB-3 (3c) and USTB-4c, respectively, under the same conditions. This is actuallyconsistent with the phenomena observed for POCs asmentioned above. However, it is noteworthy that both thenitrogen-rich structure nature and high surface area (porosity)play an important role in the I2vapor uptake of COFs.",surface area
"2목Nevertheless, additional sites such as interlayers also contributeto I2capture of COFs, as indicated by the larger absorbed I2volume (0.90 and 1.18 cm3g?1) than the experimental porevolume (0.66 and 1.01 cm3g?1) of USTB-1 and USTB-1c,respectively. This then should be responsible for the similar I2adsorption uptakes for USTB-3 and USTB-3c possessing verydi?erent BET surface areas.",surface area
