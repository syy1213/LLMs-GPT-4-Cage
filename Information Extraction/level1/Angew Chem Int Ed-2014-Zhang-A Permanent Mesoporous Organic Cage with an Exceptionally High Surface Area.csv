"[12a]However, the result-ing cage compounds were not investigated in terms ofporosity and no additional structural proof by single-crystalX-ray analysis could be provided. Cages of larger sizes, whichwere characterized in the solid state by X-ray diffraction ofsingle-crystals were synthesized by the Cooper group,[12b]theSeverin group,[12c]and Gawronski et al.[12d](see also theSupporting Information, Figure S27). Whereas the Coopercage had an outer diameter of 2.9 nm and inner diameter of1.5 nm, which is similar to a previously reported [4+6] cagecompound,[4c]the Gawronski cage was larger, especially whenthe inner cavity dimensions were taken into account (outerdiameter: 3.0 nm, inner diameter: 1.7 nm). By a combinationof metallasupramolecular chemistry and dynamic imine bondformation, Severin and co-workers prepared a cage with outerand inner diameters of 2.7 nm and 1.9 nm, respectively.Unfortunately, these larger cages failed to remain porousupon desolvation of the crystals: mainly nonporous com-pounds were observed, as has been verified by gas sorptionmeasurements.[*] Dr. G.

"Abstract: Recently, porous organic cage crystals have becomea real alternative to extended framework materials with highspecific surface areas in the desolvated state. Although majorprogress in this area has been made, the resulting porouscompounds are restricted to the microporous regime, owing tothe relatively small molecular sizes of the cages, or the collapseof larger structures upon desolvation. Herein, we present thesynthesis of a shape-persistent cage compound by the reversibleformation of 24 boronic ester units of 12 triptycene tetraolmolecules and 8 triboronic acid molecules. The cage com-pound bears a cavity of a minimum inner diameter of 2.6 nmand a maximum inner diameter of 3.1 nm, as determined bysingle-crystal X-ray analysis. The porous molecular crystalscould be activated for gas sorption by removing enclathratedsolvent molecules, resulting in a mesoporous material witha very high specific surface area of 3758 m2g/C01and a porediameter of 2.3 nm, as measured by nitrogen gas sorption.",surface area
"[3]It has been demonstrated that some of those organic cagecompounds are highly porous in the crystalline or amorphousstate, when desolvated in vacuum,[4]with reported Brunauer¨CEmmett¨CTeller (BET) surface areas (SAs) of up to2071 m2g/C01.[5]The solubility of porous organic moleculesoffers some advantages in comparison to insoluble networkmaterials:[6]porous molecules are miscible in solution ena-bling adjustment of the properties of the material;[7]anexhaustive post-functionalization by chemical reactions in theinner cavities of the cage molecules allows the functionalgroups on the surface, and hence the gas sorption propertiesof the porous materials, to be changed.",surface area

Thepore volume is Vpore=1.41 cm3g/C01, which is comparable tothat determined from the X-ray single-crystal structure byapplying the program crystal explorer (1.57 cm3g/C01).[18]NLDFT calculations (N2adsorption branch at 77 K, sphericalpores, silica material) gave a maximum pore diameter of2.03 nm with a low fitting error (1.27%). It seemed morereasonable to us to determine the pore size by using theDubinin¨CRadushkevich (DR) equation,[19]which is a highly-applicable method for porous materials with homogeneouspore structures, as it is the case for crystalline 3b. Using thismethod, the average pore diameter of the material wasdetermined to be 2.3 nm, which is in good agreement with themolecular pore size determined from the X-ray crystalstructure of solvate 3b. The crystalline phases of thedesolvated and solvated structures are not the same, as hasbeen found by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). However,owing to the accordance of the measured pore size, both byNLDFTand DR methods to that calculated from the solvatedphase, it is suggested that the molecular cages retain theirshape and remain intact during evacuation, but the assem-bling of the cages in the desolvated phase have changed.",surface area
"Solving crystal structures from PXRD data of such structuresis not trivial, and further work will be done to get more insightinto the occurring phase change during evacuation. The shapeof the sorption isotherms is similar to that reported for MIL-101, and the pore dimensions and surface areas of the cagecompound 3bare indeed comparable to MIL-101 ( Vpore=2.0 cm3g/C01; BET SA =4100 m2g/C01).[20]All data are readilyreproducible, as has been demonstrated by the synthesis andmeasurement of a second batch sample (BET SA =3475 m2g/C01). The specific surface area of 3bis higher thanfor COF-102 (BET SA =3472 m2g/C01),[21]and is the highestreported thus far for any porous cage compound. To the bestof our knowledge, 3balso represents the first single-crystal X-ray structure of any reported crystalline porous organicmaterial based on the formation of boronic esters.",surface area
"In conclusion, we have shown that it is possible tosynthesize a shape-persistent, discrete mesoporous organiccage compound by dynamic covalent formation of 24 boronicester units in one step. The resulting BET specific surface areaof 3758 m2g/C01is the highest reported thus far for any porousorganic molecules. Currently, we are working on the synthesisof even larger porous cages to gain further insight into thescope and limitations of this new and fascinating class ofporous materials.",surface area
