Ether, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, CH2Cl2 and DMF are purified by MBRAUN solvent purification systems.  9-hexadecyl-9H-carbazole,1 9-hexadecyl-3,6-diiodo-9H-carbazole,1 9-butyl-9H-carbazole-3,6-dicarbaldehyde,2 1,3,5-tri(4-formylphenyl)benzene,3 1,3,5-tri(4-aminophenyl)benzene,4 9-hexadecyl-6-iodo-9H-carbazole-3-carbaldehyde,5 and 9-octyl-9H-carbazole-3,6-diamine6 were prepared as previously described in the literature.      All reactions were conducted in oven dried glassware.  Unless otherwise specified, solvents were evaporated using a rotary evaporator after workup.  Unless otherwise specified, the purity of the compounds was ≡ 95 % based on 1H NMR spectral integration.  Flash column chromatography was performed by using a 100-150 times weight excess of flash silica gel 32-63 米m from Dynamic Absorbents Inc.  Fractions were analyzed by TLC using TLC silica gel F254 250 米m precoated-plates from Dynamic Absorbents Inc.  Analytical gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed using a Viscotek GPCmaxTM, a Viscotek Model 3580 Differential Refractive Index (RI) Detector, a Viscotek Model 3210 UV/VIS Detector and a set of two Viscotek Viscogel columns (7.8 ℅ 30 cm, l- MBLMW-3078, and l-MBMMW-3078 columns) with THF as the eluent at 30 ∼C. The analytical GPC was calibrated using monodisperse polystyrene standards.  MALDI Mass spectra were obtained on the Voyager-DE? STR Biospectrometry Workstation using sinapic acid as the matrix.  1H NMR spectra were taken on Bruker 300, Inova 400 and Inova 500 spectrometers.  13C NMR spectra were obtained on Bruker 300 and Inova 400 spectrometers.  gHSQC and gHMBC spectra were taken on Inova 500 spectrometer.  gHSQC and gHMBC for compounds 13 and 14 were acquired in C6D6 at 60∼C. All others were acquired in CDCl3 at room temperature. C6D6 (7.15 ppm), and CHCl3 (7.26 ppm) were used as internal references in 1H NMR, and C6D6 (127.88 ppm) and CHCl3 (77.23 ppm) for 13C NMR. 1H NMR data were reported in order: chemical shift, multiplicity (s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet), number of protons, coupling constants (J, Hz).   2) Experimental Procedures  9-Hexadecyl-6-vinyl-9H-carbazole-3-carbaldehyde (3):  The procedure reported by Butler and Denmark was followed.7 9-Hexadecyl-6-iodo-9H-carbazole-3-carbaldehyde (267 mg, 0.49 mmol), Pd2dba3 (22 mg, 0.024 mmol), TBAF (1.0 mL, 1.0 mmol), D4V (2,4,6,8-tetramethyl-2,4,6,8-tetravinyl-cyclotetrasiloxane , 85 uL, 0.24 mmol) and THF (12.0 mL) were added to the reaction vessel under N2.  The reaction was stirred at 80 ∼C for 4 h.  The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, filtered through a short plug of silica gel with ether, and concentrated.  The product was purified by flash column chromatography (gradient elution 5% EtOAc/hexanes to 10% EtOAc/hexanes) to yield a light yellow solid (165 mg, 76%).
