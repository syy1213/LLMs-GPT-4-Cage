"¡öRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSynthesis and Characterization ofthe Helical Cages(HCs). Pyromellitic dianhydride (BDA) was first covalentlymodified with two chiral cyclohexanediamine (R/ScHDAm) toproduce pyromellitic diimide (R/SBDI) astheedge (Figures S1and S2), and tris(4-formylphenyl)amine (TPA) was selected asthe facet, which were linked together bydynamic covalentimine bonds4toconstructR/SHC (Figure 1aand Schemes S1?S3inthe Supporting Information). Due tothe high directionrole ofintrinsically chiral V-shapedR/ScHDAm and thedynamic reactivity ofimine bonds,R/SHC were obtained athigh isolated yields (>60%) incomparison with most covalentmolecular cages. Only one molecular ionpeak was detected at1782.74138 m/z (M +H) in high-resolution massspectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS, Figures 1b, S3, and S4),confirming adiscrete [3+2]-type molecular cage structure withthreeR/SBDI and two TPA moieties.1HNMR spectroscopyfurther showed that allofthe formyl groups were convertedinto the imine bonds, and allofthe protons onR/SBDI andFigure1.Molecular design, synthesis, and characterizations. (a)Helical cages (HC) aresynthesized through dynamic imine chemistry. (b) High-resolution MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry confirms a[3+2]-type molecular structure. (c)1HNMR spectra ofRHC compared with itsprecursorsRBDI and TPA (asterisk denotes theresidual protons ofCDCl3).(d,e)Single-crystal structure ofRHC hasahelical and concave conformation withadihedral angle of¡ÏABB¡äA¡ä =60¡ã and acenter distance of4.937 ?between two nitrogen atoms ofTPA facets, much smaller than thelength ofBDI edges (9.642 ?,thedistance between two chiral carbon atoms directly linked tothesame BDI).RHC displays aglobal M-helicity forboth TPAand BDI units, while TPA propellers also have alocalP-helicity.Journal oftheAmerican Chemical Society pubs.acs.org/JACS Articlehttps://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.3c09461J.Am.Chem.Soc.2023,145,27639?2764927640TPA were inone setofchemical shifts (Figures 1c,S5, andS6), evidencing ahighly symmetric chemical environment.",topology
