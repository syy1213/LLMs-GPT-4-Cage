"N2, H2, CH 4, and CO 2 physisorption isotherms were measured up to 1 bar using a Micrometrics ASAP 2020  surface area and pore size analyzer.  Prior to the measurements, the samples were degassed  for 10 h at 100 ∼C. UHP  grade N2, H2, CH 4 and CO 2 were  used for measurements. Oil-free  vacuum pumps and oil-free pressure  regulators were  used for measurements to prevent  contamination of the samples during the degassing  process  and isotherm measurement. The total pore volume  was N2 volume adsorbed at STP when P/P 0 was 0.95. The BET surface  area was calculated in the 0.10-0.20 P/P 0 range,  and the isotherm  points chosen to calculate the BET surface  area were subject to the three consistency criteria detailed by Walton and SnurrS2.2. Synthesis  of Cage  1Dehydrated chloroform (150 mL) was added to 1,3,5-tris-(4-formyl-phenyl)triazine  (175.2 mg, 0.445 mmol)  in a beaker at room temperature. Then, a dehydrated  chloroform (70 mL) solution of (R, R)-cyclohexanediamine (87.1 mg, 0.762 mmol) was added.  The resulting  mixture was left at room temperature  for 6 days without stirring and monitored by 1H NMR. Cage  1 was obtained as a light yellow  shining powder by removing the solvent under vacuum  (219 mg, 96.4%).1H NMR  (CDCl 3, 300 MHz,  298K, ppm):  汛 = 8.60 (d, J =  7.5Hz, 24H), 8.31 (s, 12H),  7.78 (d, J = 7.6Hz, 24H), 3.51 (s, 12H), 1.87每1.67 (m, 48H). 13C NMR (CDCl 3, 75 MHz, 298 K, ppm): 汛 = 170.8, 159.8, 139.6, 137.5, 133.0, 128.9, 128.1, 74.2, 32.7, 24.3.

"As typical molecular container compounds, organic molecularc a g e s( O M C s ) 〞 d e f i n e da ss h a p e - p e r s i s t e n t ,t h r e e - d i m e n s i o n a lorganic molecules with permanent cavities〞are attractive as hostmaterials and have found application in host每guest chemistry.1In2009, however, Cooper et al. demonstrated that OMCs can self-assemble into crystalline materi als with permanent void space,2thus showing potential applicatio ns in gas sorption. This new typeof porous material is solution-processable, which sets it apartfrom other porous materials such as zeolites or the well-knownextended network materials ( e.g., metal每organic frameworks3),which sparked increasing interest in OMCs over the past fiveyears.4Cooper,5Mastalerz,6Zhang7and others8have reported avariety of OMCs, and among the resultant porous materials cannow be found examples with high selectivity for the adsorption ofCO2over N 26b,7aor with a high Brunauer每Emmett每Teller (BET)surface area of up to 3758 m2g/C01.6dHowever, it has to beemphasized that, this new area is still far away from being well-explored. The synthesis of large O MCs is still quite challengingand sometimes it is difficult5bto self-assemble these largemolecules into stable porous materials with high surface area,no matter whether crystalline or in an amorphous state.",surface area

Commun., 2015, 51, 1976--1979 This journal is ?The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015Cooper group.5aAdditionally, the volume calculated for thecage amounts to 2073 ?3by the volume of the inscribed sphere,which is also larger than that of CC5 (1356 ?3). In its crystallo-graphic packing, strong CH每 pinteractions between the bridge-head proton atoms of cyclohexane and the aromatic rings werefound, evidenced by a distance of 2.94每2.97 ?. The self-assembly mode observed for cage 1differs somewhat fromthose reported for other [4+6] OMCs, as the cyclohexane moietyof cage 1is able to insert itself into the cavity of an adjacentcage to form a one-dimensional (1D) supramolecular chain(Fig. 2b). These 1D supramolecular chains further self-assemble into a porous molecular packing through p每pstack-ing (Fig. 2c) between the triazine and benzene rings witha distance from 3.66 to 3.86 ?, which is a typical distance forp每pstacking interactions. This packing mode partially blocksthe inherently present pore of cage 1(B2070 ?3) and leads to awinding pore structure in the solid state crystal of cage 1. Thecage 1has a pore volume of 6738 ?3per unit cell with a proberadius of 1.82 ?, or 39.1% of the total volume of the material, asindicated by the orange Connolly surface representation inFig. 2d. From this structure, the cage was calculated17usingthe Poreblazer program to have an accessible surface area of987 m2g/C01.",surface area
"To investigate the permanent porosity of cage 1, a crystallinesample of cage 1was treated for 10 h at 100 1C under highvacuum. Powder X-ray di?raction (PXRD) analysis showed thatcage 1loses its crystallinity during the activation process andchanges into an amorphous state. However, as most of theporosity of cage 1is inherent to its molecular structure ratherthan to solid state packing e?ects, the resultant amorphoussample still features considerable gas uptake properties. Asshown in Fig. 3a, the N2sorption isotherm of desolvated cage 1at 77 K shows a type I isotherm with a type IV character athigher relative pressures. The total pore volume was estimatedto be 0.54 cm3g/C01, and the calculated BET surface area was1181 m2g/C01, which is comparable to that of the largest [4+6]cages reported so far by Cooper5a(CC5, 1333 m2g/C01) andMastalerz6b(1375 m2g/C01). The experimental pore volume andthe BET surface area of cage 1are both larger than thetheoretical values calculated from the single crystal data(0.50 cm3g/C01and 987 m2g/C01, respectively), which presumablyresults from the solvent release process during heat andvacuum treatment of cage 1. In order for the quite voluminousDMSO molecules to be released from the cage cavity, thecyclohexane substituents blocking the path of the DMSO mole-cules have to be moved aside. As a result, the sample loses itscrystallographic order and becomes amorphous (the processappears to be not reversible), but also eliminates the location-obstruction between cages due to cyclohexane insertion and theinherent molecular pores of the cages are re-established. TheH2adsorption isotherm of cage 1(Fig. 3b) shows a 80 cm3g/C01and 58 cm3g/C01H2uptake at 77 K and 87 K under 1 bar,respectively, which also compares well with other [4+6] cages.",surface area

"The target cage 1was synthesized (Scheme 1) by iminecondensation of 1,3,5-tris-(4-formyl-phenyl)triazine16and ( R,R)-1,2-cyclohexamediamine in a [4+6] cycloimination reaction. Thesynthesis was performed by simple dissolving of the reactants inCHCl3and leaving the solution at room temperature withoutstirring for several days. The reaction process was monitored by1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 1a and Fig. S1, see ESI ?). Initially, alarge number of cyclic and oligomeric reaction products wereformed. Over time, the spectra became more and more struc-tured and after an extended reaction time of six days, thethermodynamic equilibrium is reached. After removal of thesolvent, cage 1was finally isolated as a light yellow powder.",topology
"Single crystals of cage 1were obtained by slow di?usion ofDMSO into a CHCl 3solution in an H-shaped tube at 40 1C andtheir solid-state structure was determined by X-ray crystallo-graphy at the Beijing Synchrotron Facility. Cage 1crystallizes inthe orthorhombic system with the chiral space group P212121(see ESI ?). It has a pseudo T(tetrahedral) symmetry with anestimated external distance of 3.0 nm by the diameter of thecircumscribed sphere (Fig. 2a). This is larger than that of other[4+6] OMCs, such as CC5 (2.9 nm) recently reported by theFig. 1 (a) Dynamic covalent formation of cage 1monitored by1H NMRspectroscopy (300 MHz, 298 K, CDCl 3) at di?erent times (blue: 1 d; green:3 d; red: 6 d); and (b) the 2D DOSY NMR spectrum of the cage in CDCl 3.",topology
