"Regarding the chemical stability, the crystallinity of PAC 1is maintained in aqueous solvents,such as boiling water, high-concentrated acid and alkali; mixtures of solvents, such as 1 MH2SO4/MeOH/H 2O solution, are also tolerated. Investigations on the chiral sensing per-formance show that PAC 1enables enantioselective recognition of axially chiral biarylmolecules.https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31785-4 OPEN1Institute of Functional Materials, Department of Chemistry, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, Jilin, China.2Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility(SSRF), Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.3State Key Laboratory of Supramolecular Structure andMaterials, Institute of Theoretical Chemistry, College of Chemistry, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.4These authors contributed equally: Dong-Xu Cui,Yun Geng.?email: suncy009@nenu.edu.cn ;wangxl824@nenu.edu.cnNATURE COMMUNICATIONS |         (2022) 13:4011 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31785-4 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 11234567890():,;Chiral self-sorting via covalent and non-covalent bonds isa natural phenomenon, which presents a dominantability in guiding biologic systems toward the formationof speci ?c products out of equally multiple possibilities1每4.T h estudy of external stimuli and intrinsic factors that affect chiralself-sorting in arti ?cial systems could not only provide com-prehension of recognition discipline in nature but open newopportunities for the preparation of homochiral materials andrelated applications for chiral sensing and asymmetrictransformation5. Controllable processes will be helpful toacquire a deeper understanding of the principles in chiral self-sorting. Compared with covalent and coordination bonds, thedif?culty in governing the direction of intermolecular interac-tions makes it very hard to realize controllable chiral self-sorting. It is well known that weak molecular interactions sig-ni?cantly affect the supramolecular-level assembly in organ-isms. Therefore, it is of great signi ?cance to understand thecontrollable chiral self-sorting at the supramolecular level.",affiliation

"Researches on assembling racemic small molecules into cageshave been reported and selective chiral self-sorting has beenachieved in the covalent cage formation16每28. For example, Caoet al. demonstrated chiral self-sorting driven by the intramo-lecular interactions, which results in [4 +4] radical homochiralcages20. They also prepared the largest [4 +6] imine cagesformed by narcissistic chiral self-sorting27.

"For the synthesis of chiral POCs, imine condensation hasbeen the prevailing route, and a large number of structures havebeen reported, normally adopting ?exible skeletons with centralchiral amines as building blocks6,10,11,20,29每34.A l t h o u g hs e l f -correction mechanism of the reversible covalent bond greatlyfacilitates the accessibility of chiral POCs, the intrinsic dynamiccharacter of imine makes this bond low-energetic stability, andprone to be attacked e.g. by nucleophiles, leading to structuraldecomposition even in moisture ambient humidity35每40. Poorchemical stability has been a thorny issue faced by chiral iminecages and restricts their practical applications41每43. Recently,post-synthetic modi ?cations have been proposed as astraightforward way to enhance their stability34,35,44每47.F o rexample, Cooper and co-workers converted the imine in CC3 toan amine, and the resulting structure can be stable over a widepH range (pH =1.7每12.3)37.M a s t a l e r ze ta l .r e p o r t e dt h etransformation of imine bonds in [4 +6] salicylimine cage intochemically robust amide bonds via Pinnick oxidation45.F u r -thermore, they utilized the Povarov reaction and the sub-sequent oxidation to transform the salicylimine cage into aquinoline cage which is stable under harsh acidic and basicconditions46.

"DiscussionIn conclusion, a pair of axially chiral [4 +6] PAC ( 1-Sand1-R)i sconstructed from the condensation of binaphthylenediamine andtridentate aldehyde. As far as we know, this is one of the fewexamples of chiral POCs having the aromatic structure reportedto date. The keto-enol tautomerism-induced conversion of imineto amine is observed in the cage assembly. The keto-enaminestructure renders PAC 1an exceptional stability under water andconcentrated acid while the hydrophobic characteristic is crucialfor alkali resistance. Controllable chiral self-sorting at bothmolecular and supramolecular levels is observed. DFT calcula-tions show that the exclusive self-recognition on single cageformation is an enthalpy-driven process, while the narcissisticand social self-sorting on cage-cage supramolecular assembly isregulated by different solvents via C 每H＃羽and羽每羽interactions.The reversible transformation of the homochiral cage and race-mic structure is studied by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.",topology
