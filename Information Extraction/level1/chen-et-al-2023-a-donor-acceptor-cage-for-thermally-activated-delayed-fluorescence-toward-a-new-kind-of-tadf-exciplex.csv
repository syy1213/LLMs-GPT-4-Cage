The reaction was kept at 110 ¡ãC for 0.5 h and cooled to 25 oC. P4 (500 mg, 0.754 mmol), t-BuOK (495 mg 4.4 mmol) and diphenylmethanimine (740 ¦ÌL, 4.4 mmol) were added under nitrogen atmosphere, and the mixture was warmed to reflux for another 36 hours. After the reaction was completed, it was cooled to 25 oC. and filtered by diatomite. The solvent was removed under vacuum, and the residue was purified by column chromatography with PE/EA = 6/1 as the eluent to yield the compound P5 as a dark red-brown powder (500 mg, 80%) after drying under vacuum. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl 3): ¦Ä 7.94 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 3H), 7.82 (d, J = 4.0 Hz, 6H), 7.42¨C7.50 (m, 9H), 7.21¨C7.25 (m, 15H), 6.89 (s, 3H), 6.77 (d, J = 8 Hz, 3H), 4.60 (t, J = 8 Hz, 6H), 1.55¨C1.62 (m, 6H), 1.05¨C1.14 (m, 6H), 0.76 (t, J = 4 Hz, 9H). 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl 3): ¦Ä 167.98, 146.89, 141.69, 140.26, 138.45, 136.91, 130.70, 129.85, 129.46, 128.60, 128.34, 128.11, 121.49, 119.84, 114.78, 103.44, 46.72, 31.45, 20.00, 13.86.

Secondly, compound P5 (105 mg, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in THF (10 mL) under N 2 at 25 oC, followed with the dropwise addition of 2M HCl (0.5 mL) with syringe. After stirring for 30 min, the precipitate formed was filtered and washed with THF. After drying under vacuum, the precipitate was evenly dispersed in deionized water by sonication and TEA was slowly added dropwise with stirring at 25 oC.
