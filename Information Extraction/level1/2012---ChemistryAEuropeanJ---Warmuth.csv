Experimental Section  General Reagents and chromatography solvents were purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification, apart from THF, which was distilled in present of benzophenone and sodium wire. 1H NMR spectra recorded in D2O or (CD3)2SO were referenced to residual H2O and CHD2S(O)CD3  at 4.79 and 2.50 ppm, respectively. 13C NMR spectra recorded in (CD3)2SO were referenced to (CD3)2SO at 39.5ppm. 13C NMR spectra recorded in D2O were referenced to external (CH3)2SO at 39.39 ppm. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded by using an Applied Biosystems Voyager DE-Pro mass spectrometer with 2,4,6-trihydroxylacetophenone (THAP) as the matrix. Positive molecular ions were usually detected as proton, sodium or potassium adducts for the compounds reported herein.  ESI mass spectra were recorded on a Finnigan LCQ Duo mass spectrometer  2.

TBAF!3H2O was (0.920 g, 2.9 mmol) was dried at 58 oC in high vacuum for 2h and dissolved in 15 mL dry THF.  The TBAF solution was added to the solution of 11 in THF and the reaction mixture was stirred under Argon for 4h. Several drops of water were added to the reaction mixture and THF was removed in vacuum. The solid residue suspended in 20 mL water and sonicated. The resulting mixture was filtered and the solid was washed with water and dried, which yielded the crude product as yellowish solid. The solid was purified by silica gel column chromatography using 7:3 CH2Cl2:IPA (v/v).
