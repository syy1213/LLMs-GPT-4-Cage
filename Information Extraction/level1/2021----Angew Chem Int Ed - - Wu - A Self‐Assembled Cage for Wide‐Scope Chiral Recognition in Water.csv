"Here weself-assembled ananionic cage bycombiningGa3+cation, trishydrazide andsalicy laldehyde ina[6++4++12]manner .Thecage bears twelve sulfonic acidunits,endowingwater solubility .Thehydrazone bonds within thecage frame-work were observed toberemarkably robust inwater, helpingtoavoid hydrolysis that often occurs insome oftheself-assembled systems containing typical imine .Ontheonehand,thewater -compatibility allows thecage totake advantage ofhydrophobic effect torecognize guests inaqueous media. Ontheother hand, thenegative charges onthecage help toenhance thebinding affinity ofcage toaccommodate cationicguests ,some ofwhich areconsidered difficult toberecog-nized inwater duetotheir hydrophilicity .Different from mostofthepreviously reported coordination hosts ,[14]thecageprovides theguests with two binding modes ,ineitherinclusion orperipheral[15]manner ,orboth.Theconsequenceisthat, thecage isable torecognize awiderange ofguests ,whose sizes could beeither smaller than, orexceed thevolume oftheinner cavity ofthecage.Within theframeworkofasingle cage,allofthefour trishydrazone ligands ofthecage adopt thesame rotational conformation, andthesixGa3+vertexes have thesame axial chirality .Suchbehaviorsendow thecage homochirality ,andthecage product istherefore actually aracemic mixture oftwo homochiralenantiomers .Upon recognizing achiral guest, either inter-nally orexternally ,oneofthecage enantiomers became morethermodynamically favored than theother, producing CDsignals forchirality sensing .Theenantiomeric excess (ee)values ofavariety ofenantiomer mixtures could bedeter -mined quantitatively ,byrecording theCDsignal intensities .[*]G.Wu,Y.Chen, S.Fang,L.Tong,L.Shen, C.Ge,Prof. Y.Pan,Prof. H.LiDepartment ofChemist ry,Zhejiang Universi tyHangzhou 310027 (China)E-mail :lihao2015@zju .edu.cnX.ShiCollege ofGeograp hyandEnvironmen t,Shandong Normal Univer-sityJinan 250358 (P.R.China)Supportin ginforma tion andtheORCID identifica tion number(s) fortheauthor(s) ofthisarticle canbefound under :https ://doi.org/ 10.1002/ani e.2021041 64.",affiliation
