Tris(2,3,5,6 -tetrachloro- 4-iodophenyl)methane  was obtained  as a white powder in 89% yield ( 2.10 g ). 1H NMR (5 00 MHz, THF -d8, ¦Ä ppm): 6.9 8 (s, 1H).  The 1H NMR spectrum matches that in the  literature.2   PTM -H: Tris(2,3,5,6 -tetrachloro- 4-iodophenyl)methane  (1.15 g, 1. 11 mmol) and  4-formylboronic acid ( 0.78 g, 5.20  mmol) were dis persed  in a mixture solvent consisting of toluene  120 mL, H 2O 20 mL and ethanol  15 mL . The reaction mixture  was degassed for 30 min, before Pd(PPh 3)4 (0.16 g, 0.13 mmol) and K 2CO 3 (0.73 mg, 5.29 mmol) were added. The reaction mixture was stirred at 9 0 ¡ãC under an N 2 atmosphere for 36 h. After cooling to room temperature, the solvent was removed under  vacuum . Residue was poured into water and then extracted with CH 2Cl2. The resulting organic extra ct was washed with water (1 x 50 mL) and brine ( 2 x 50 mL), dried  over anhydrous Na 2SO4, and then concentrated to give the crude product.  Purification by column chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate/dichloromethane ( 8:1:1); silica gel) yielded the pure PTM -H as a light yellow solid ( 0.71g, 65% ). 1H NMR (5 00 MHz, CD 2Cl2, ¦Ä ppm) 10.10 (s, 3H), 8.03 (d, J = 8. 5 Hz, 6H), 7.48 (d, J =8. 5 Hz, 6H), 7.28 (s, 1H).  The 1H NMR spectrum match es that in the  literature.3 PTM -P: PTM -H (51.5 mg, 0.053 mmol) was dissolved in dry THF (40 mL).  The mixture was degassed for 30 min,  before  tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (40% in water)  (69 mg, 0.106 mmol, 2.0 equiv.) was added. The resulting mixture was stirred at room  temperature  under N 2 atmosphere in dark  for 12 h. The reaction mixture changed from colorless to dark blue.  p-Chloranil ( 31.3  mg, 0. 127 mmol, 2.4 equiv .) was added, after which  the mixture was stirred for  another  8 h. The reaction mixture changed from dark blue to dark red.  The solvent was removed under reduced  pressure at room temperature. The resulting residue was dissolved in 3 mL CH 2Cl2, then purified by  column chromatography  (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate/dichloromethane ( 10:1:1); silica gel) . Pure PTM -P was obtained as red crystals ( 43.7 mg, 85% ). 1H NMR (5 00 MHz, CD 2Cl2, ¦Ä ppm): Owing to the paramagnetic property  of PTM -P, only one broad peak at 9.97  (s, 3H, CHO ) was observed. Both PTM -P in solid -state and solution phase are very sensitive to light, even decompose in several hours under the daylight.  We also found that PTM -P undergoes fast transformation  to PTM -H in CDCl 3 due to the existence of a little amount of HCl and reductive COCl 2 produced by decomposition of CDCl 3.

Synthesis of  PTM -TC  PTM -TC: PTM -P (13.5 mg, 0.0 14 mmol)  was dissolved in a mixture solvent consisting of C 6H5Cl 3 mL and CH 2Cl2 150 ¦ÌL.  A solution of tris(2 -aminoethyl)amine (71.3 ¦ÌL, 0.205 mM)  in C 6H5Cl was then added. The red transparent reaction solution was sealed and stirred at 60 oC in dark  under the protection of nitrogen atmosphere  for 6 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture  was passed through a 0.22 ¦Ìm filter into nine 1 mL clean glass tube s. The tubes were placed in three 20 mL vials containing 1 mL of n -hexane , and the vials were capped and kept at 25 oC. Slow vapor diffusion of n -hexane into the reaction mixture solution over the course of 1 week yielded red block single crystals of PTM -TC. Finally, the red crystals  were dried under  vacuum  at room temperature , giving the racemate PTM -TC (11.0 mg, 75% ) as a red crystalline solid.  1H NMR spectrum recorded  (Figure S 5) was significantly broadened due to its paramagnetic nature.

"The synthesis of PTM -TC can be  performed in a reaction scale up to  at least 300 mg in one pot . The self-assembly synthetic reaction  can be carried out successfully in a variety of organic solvents . The feasible solvents for self -assembly have two features, including  i) the solvent should provide enough S6  solubility for PTM -P (at least around 1 mg/mL) , ii) the solvent molecule should have a complementary size  to occupy the cavity of  PTM -TC so that the former acts as a template for the cage formation.  Our experiments demonstrated that the feasible solvents include  chlorobenzene, benzene, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, pyridine, and mesitylene  (for ESI -MS and EPR characterizations, see the Figure S 16 and S17).  It¡¯s noteworthy that the self -assembly of PTM -TC should be performed within no longer than  12 hours  at 60 oC and reaction temperature  higher than  90 oC should be avoided. This is because PTM radical might undergo  decomposition/hydrogenation at elevated temperature ( i.e., 90 oC) or if the reaction time is too long . In fact, in the case of  reaction temperature higher than 90 oC, the condensation of PTM -P and TREN  led to light red precipitates which cannot be dissolve in all of the common ly used  solvents , indicating the generation of oligomers or polymers (Figure S 7 b). We recorded the h igh-resolution MS  of the solution phase of the reaction mixture, which  demonstrated the formation of the analogues of PTM -TC, whose four PTM radical units are   all or partially hydrogenated (Figure S7  d).",comprehensive synthesis

"[14]Here, a radical cage containing four spin centers was self-assembled in high yield in a one-pot manner by condensinga trisamine and a trisformyl radical in a [4+4] manner. Withineach cage framework, intramolecular interactions such as[CH¡¤¡¤¡¤ p] and hydrogen-bonding occur. Such interactionsresult in chiral self-sorting in the cage formation.[15]That is,even although the propeller-shaped trisformyl precursor hastwo atropisomeric forms, each cage contains only one type ofthese two atropisomers. Such chiral self-sorting results in thecage having two enantiomeric isomers, which were isolatedvia chiral HPLC. Once isolated, each enantiomer of the cagehas stable homochirality, probably because the inter-compo-nent steric hindrance prevents flipping of the phenyl unitswithin the cage framework. Magnetic characterization showsthat the self-assembled radical cage behaves as a group oforganized while independent radicals, resulting from therelatively long distances between the radical carbon centers.",topology
"PTM radicals are reported to be highly stable because oftheir three polychlorophenyl units that are grafted onto thecentral sp2hybridized radical carbon atom.[1c,16]On the onehand, such three units, which are rather bulky, protect theradical from dimerization. On the other hand, the phenylunits undergo resonance with the central radical electron,stabilizing the latter from either reduction or oxidation. Inaddition, because of the steric hindrance between polychlor-ophenyl units, PTM adopts a propeller-like conformation,resulting in two atropisomers, namely Plus (P) and Minus(M). The energy barrier of these two atropisomers under-going interconversion was determined to be ca. 23 kcalmol/C01,as indicated by Veciana and Crespo a few decades ago.[17]A trisaldehyde precursor containing a PTM radicalmoiety ( PTM-P ) was synthesized from its correspondingpolychlorotriphenylmethane ( PTM-H )[18]by deprotonationwith nBu4N¡¤OH, followed by oxidation with p-chloranil(Figure 1). Combining PTM-H and tris(2-aminoethyl)amine(TREN) in a 1:1 ratio in CHCl3at room temperature, onlyproduced some intractable oligomers, probably because theformation of tetrahedrons require the trisformyl precursor toadopt a planar triangular geometry, instead of the pyramidshape that PTM-H has. Raising the reaction temperature to608C did not improve the self-assembly outcome. As a com-parison, combining PTM-P , which is indeed a mixture of twoatropisomers namely PandMisomers, and TREN in a 1:1.05ratio in C6H5Cl and CH2Cl2mixture (95:5 by volume) at 60 8Cproduced a clear red solution containing PTM-TC (Figure 1)as the predominant product. The formation of the [4 +4]tetrahedron PTM-TC was confirmed by high-resolution massspectrometry (HRMS) (Figure 2a, S6). The peaks corre-sponding to [ M+2H]2+,[M+3H]3+, and [ M+4H]4+wereobserved at m/z2123.7022, 1416.1350, and 1062.3533, con-sistent with the calculated values.Abstract: Condensation of an inherently C3-symmetric poly-chlorotriphenylmethyl (PTM) radical trisaldehyde with tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (TREN) yields a [4+4] tetrahedral radicalcage as a racemic pair of homochiral enantiomers in 75%isolated yield. The structure was characterized by X-raycrystallography, confirming the homochirality of each cageframework. The homochirality results from intramolecular[CH¡¤¡¤¡¤ p] and hydrogen-bonding interactions within the cageframework. The four PTM radicals in a cage undergo weakthrough-space coupling. Magnetic measurements demon-strated that each cage bears 3.58 spins.",topology
