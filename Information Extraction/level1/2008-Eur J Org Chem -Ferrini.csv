The final solution was heated atdifferent temperatures (20, 60, 120 ∼C) for different times (14, 3,18 h) according to Scheme 1. The reaction mixture was poured intoan ice 每water mixture and repeatedly extracted with ethyl acetate(3/H1100320 mL), washed with water and dried with Na2SO 4; the sol-vents were then evaporated under vacuum. The residue was puri-fied by flash chromatography to give compounds 2每6and 8and 9.",comprehensive synthesis

X-ray crystallography and density functionalcalculations were used for their structural determination andevaluation of their chemical properties. Their role as metalIntroductionCalixarenes[1]are a particularly interesting class ofmacrocyclic compounds that continue to receive a large de-gree of attention as a result of their wide ranging and prac-tically useful features. Host每guest properties of these com-pounds towards cations, anions and neutral species are use-ful for analytical purposes,[2]as well as for the preparationof new catalytic systems.[3]In addition, a biological role ofcalixarene-containing structures was recently evidenced dueto their ability to simulate supramolecular cavities of activesites.",this paper's author
