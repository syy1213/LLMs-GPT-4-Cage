"Dynamic gas breakthrough measurement experiments  In typical breakthrough experiments, ~ 0.56 g of pre -activated NKPOC -1-¦Á was placed in quartz tubing (8 mm diameter) to form fixed bed. First, the adsorbent bed was purged under a 30 cm3 min-1 flow of He gas at 60 ?C for 60 min prior to breakthrough experiment. Upon cooling to room temperature, the gas flow was switched to the  desired gas mixtures at a particular flow rate (the respective flow rates are mentioned in the main manuscript). Herein, binary (2:1 C 3H4/C3H6 and C 3H4/C3H8) and ternary (2:1:1 C 3H4/C3H6/C3H8) C3-hydrocarbon mixtures were performed for breakthrough experi ments at 25 ?C and 1 bar. The outlet composition was continuously monitored by a gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC2030 with a FID detector)  until complete breakthrough was achieved. After each breakthrough experiment, the packed column bed was regenerated at 120 oC with constant He flow (30 cm3 min-1) for ~120 min to ensure complete sample regeneration.  The total gas flow rate s of C3H4/C3H6, C3H4/C3H8 and C 3H4/C3H6/C3H8 are 0 .95, 1.1 and 1.0 mL/min, respectively .  S3  Single crystal X -ray crystallography  Single crystals of NKPOC -1-¦Á (0.2 mm¡Á0.2 mm¡Á0.05 mm)  and NKPOC -1-¦Â (0.2 mm¡Á0.2 mm¡Á0.05 mm) were collected at 120 K on an Oxford SuperNova diffractometer equipped with graphite monochromated Mo -Ka radiation (¦Ë = 0.71073 ?).  The structures were solved by the direct method and refined by the full -matrix least -squares method on F2 with anisotropic thermal parameters for all non -hydrogen atoms.  We used the ¡®squeeze¡¯ of PLATON  to remove the disordered solvent molecules of NKPOC -1-¦Â, the SQUEEZE command was not performed for NKPOC -1-¦Á. Crystallographic data and structure refinement data are shown in Table S 3. The crystal data files of  NKPOC -1-¦Á and NKPOC -1-¦Â were deposited into the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) and assigned numbers  1904744 and 1904745, r espectively.",CCDC

"coordinate covalent bonds, and the latter utilize weaker forcessuch as hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions30,31Molecular crystals might therefore be expected to undergo thephase transformations required of SPCs with lower activationenergies and less strain than ?exible MOFs.1Such molecularcrystals provide a distinct strategy for creating a newgeneration of guest-responsive materials.32Porous organic cages (POCs)33?37are a relatively recentlyintroduced type of molecular crystal and are ideal candidates toserve as SPCs1,38because they can exhibit both intrinsicporosity and extrinsic porosity. Moreover, POCs possessdistinctly di ?erent features from network materials (e.g.,MOFs, zeolites) especially solubility in common solvents.They can also o ?er high chemical stability, low density, andgood processability, allowing for ease of handling, recrystalliza-tion, and thin ?lm fabrication. However, although POCs havebeen developed for over a decade,39?45their use in preparingSPCs that exhibit stimuli-r esponsive dynamic sorptionbehavior and reversible structural transformations is underex-plored. We report herein the synthesis of [2 + 3] imide-basedorganic cage NKPOC-1 (NKPOC = Nankai porous organiccage), which exhibits both intrinsic and extrinsic porosity inthe solid state ( Scheme 1 ). Speci ?cally, upon exposure tovarious gas molecules, activated NKPOC-1 crystals reversiblyswitch from a ¡°closed ¡±nonporous phase ( ¦Á) to two types ofporous ¡°open ¡±phases ( ¦Âand¦Ã). We address the relevance ofthese phenomena to gas separations and use moleculardynamics (MD) calculations and in situ adsorption/PXRDexperiments to study the mechanism of the gate-openingsorption behavior of NKPOC-1 .",topology
"¡öRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSynthesis and Characterization of NKPOC-1. NKPOC-1was prepared via a one-step condensation reaction of a?exible triamine and a rigid dianhydride in acetic acid ( Figure1a). The1H NMR spectrum ( Figure S1 ) has three signals at8.07, 7.47, and 6.35 ppm, which can be assigned to hydrogenatoms on aromatic rings, indicative of the symmetric structureofNKPOC-1 . Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) has a signal at m/z= 1067.2991 corresponding to theexpected [2 + 3] product [C60H42N8O12]H+.",topology
