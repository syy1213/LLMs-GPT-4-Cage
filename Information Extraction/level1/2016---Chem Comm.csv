"In this work, we aim to control the size while functionalizingthe cavity interiors simultaneously. Our strategy is to introducecertain polar anchors inside the [2+3] POCs as shown in Fig. 1,which is expected to display a better gas separation capability.We report herein a [2+3] phosphate organic cage (cage 1) viatheSchi?-base condensation between a phosphate based trialdehydewith a unique tetrahedron geometry and (1 R,2R)-(/C0)-1,2-cyclohexane-diamine (Scheme 1). The X-ray structure of cage 1 indicates thatboth of the polar P QO units point inside the cavity and partitionit into three smaller domains. It is found that this materialexhibits excellent selectivity of CO2over CH 4at room tempera-ture, where the divided subunits of cage 1 are believed to haveFig. 1 The strategy to partition and functionalize porous organic cages.aState Key Laboratory of Coordination Chemistry, Nanjing University, Nanjing210093, P.

"The targeted cage product could be easily synthesized by aone-step [2+3] imidization reaction with a high yield of 78%between tris(4-formylphenyl)phosphate and (1 R,2R)-(/C0)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine in acetonitrile/chloroform (v/v = 5 : 1) atroom temperature (Scheme 1). ESI-MS spectra of the reactionmixture reveal two positive peaks at m/z= 1055.75 and 1077.75(Fig. S6, ESI ?), respectively, corresponding to [2+3 + H]+and[2+3 + Na]+species. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI ?), the successfulformation of imine units in cage 1 could also be verified by thechange in IR spectra, where the absorption peak of aldehydegroups in tris(4-formylphenyl)phosphate at 1705 cm/C01isreplaced by a new absorption peak observed at 1643 cm/C01forthe cage compound. Furthermore, the structural integrity ofcage 1 has been clearly evidenced by1H,13C and31P NMRspectroscopy (see ESI ?) in CDCl 3because of its good solubility.",topology
"The single crystal of cage 1 crystallizes in the cubic P213space group. As depicted in Fig. S9 (ESI ?), the three benzenerings with a phosphate moiety in cage 1 have the sameorientation, which is di?erent from that in the free trialdehydeprecursor. The separations between the O atom of P QO bondand the centroids of the three benzene rings have been shortenedfrom 5.20, 4.20 and 4.02 ? in the trialdehyde precursor to 3.85 ?in cage 1, indicative of the slight increase of tension after formingthe [2+3] cage. It is worth mentioning that the arrangement oftwo PQOa d o p t st h e endo¨Cendo orientation, partitioning thecavity into three small subunits. The distance between the twoO atoms of the P QO bonds is calculated to be only 1.5 ? (Fig. 2A)regardless of the kinetic radii of related atoms, which will blockall the gas molecules passing through the three subunits. TheThree small cavities have the same diameter, approximately 3.4 ?(Fig. 2B), and the window is measured as 4.0 ? (Fig. S11, ESI ?).",topology

"In summary, cavity segmentation has been achieved byintroducing two polar inner-directed P QO bonds in a chiral[2+3] organic molecular cage, which leads to the selective CO 2capture and CH 4exclusion owing to the size-matching andpolarity e?ects. Binding energy calculations between the guestand host molecules give theoretical support to the importanceof the PQO bond partition as well as the overwhelmingabsorption sites of P QO bonds for CO 2, and hence explainsthe selective adsorption of CO 2. This work is suggested toprovide a practical synthetic strategy to control and function-alize the cavity of POCs, and the successful construction ofcage 1 promotes us to extend functional POCs by using otherbuilding blocks to finely adjust the size and polarity of theresultant cavity. In addition, the current study is believed tothrow some light on the design of new organic porous materialsand possible applications on gas separations.",topology
