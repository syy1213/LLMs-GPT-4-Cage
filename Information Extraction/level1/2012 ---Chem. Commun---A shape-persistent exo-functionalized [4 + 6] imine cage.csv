"In recent years, the interest in porous materials from discreteorganic molecules substantially increased because it wasdemonstrated that speci?c surface areas for such systems canreach 3000 m2g/C01.1,2Those compounds can be distinguishedinto extrinsic and intrinsic porous materials.1,3Extrinsicporous materials derive from molecules that do not containany prede?ned pores or voids.",surface area
"2In contrast, intrinsic porous materials contain voids orcavities in the molecular precursor itself, which essentiallycontribute to the porosity of the materials. This portion ofintrinsic porosity diminishes the chances of losing the propertyof porosity or surface area while the crystalline self-assembledarrangement collapses during removal of enclathrated solventmolecules. Therefore, such mol ecules can form porous materialsalso in the amorphous state, as long as the molecular structureis shape-persistent and does not pack e?ciently (frustratedpacking). This has been demonstrated for example for triptycenetris(nickel salphenes), which have a Brunauer每Emmett每Tellersurface area (SABET) of 499 m2g/C01.5Furthermore,cucurbit[7]uril, which is a shape-persistent torus-like molecule,showed in the amorphous state a SABETof 293 m2g/C01.6In thisrespect, materials derived from shape-persistent cage compoundsare superior. The ?rst example in the literature was given byAtwood and co-workers, who re-in vestigated the noria molecule,originally introduced by Nishikubo et al.7They showed that thismolecule forms an amorphous porous material with SA BET=280每350 m2g/C01.8We introduced the synthesis of shape-persistent endo-functionalized [4 + 6] cage compounds 3a每e by the iminecondensation of triptycene triamine 19and salicyldialdehydes2a每e (Scheme 1).10,11Although those materials showed thehighest surface areas (up to SA BET= 2071 m2g/C01) in thecrystalline state,11,12they have reasonable surface areas ofapprox. 700 m2g/C01in the amorphous state too.12Cooper et al. demonstrated that the technique of solventremoval for activation of the material is crucial to the morphologyand as a consequence to the gas-accessible speci?c surface area.13For instance, the so-called CC3has in its ( R)-enantiomeric crystal-line form a SA BETof 624 m2g/C01,14whereas the surface area wassubstantially increased to SA BET= 859 m2g/C01when desolvatedby freeze-drying.13Investigations of the m aterials morphologyrevealed mainly an amorphous character. This was till date thehighest reported speci?c surf ace area of an amorphous porouscompound consisting of one molecular structurally de?ned,discrete organic compound, exclusively.",surface area
"The sorption isotherm (Fig. 4) can be classi?ed as a type-Iform, which is characteristic of microporous materials.17Theadsorbed amount of nitrogen is Vmax= 391 cm3g/C01atP/P0=0.95. The speci?c surface areas are SA BET=9 1 9m2g/C01and1037 m2g/C01if the Langmuir-model is considered. These are, tothe best of our knowledge, the highest surface areas of aporous amorphous material, consisting of discrete organicmolecules exclusively.",surface area
"To conclude, we introduced a new type of exo-functionalized[4+6] cage compound, which was synthesized in 68% yield. Theamorphous material derived from this compound has a surfacearea of 1037 m2g/C01, which is the highest reported speci?c surfacearea among amorphous materials consisting of discrete organicmolecules exclusively. Furthermore, the material adsorbs14.8 wt% CO2with a high selectivity against CH 4(1.06 wt%).20Furthermore, the exo-directing functional groups o?er the oppor-tunity to synthesize a new type of cage-MOF21viathe complexationof metal ions by the salicylimine subunits.",surface area

Several reasons against the form ation of polymeric by-products i) If the reaction did not run to completion, e.g. at lower reaction temperature, we observed the formation of condensation pr oducts, which can be assigned to smaller intermediates of the final cage compound [4+6]-12 H 2O (cage compound 5) with [n(T)+m(D)]-x(H 2O) (with T = triptycene triamine and D = dialdehyde). These intermediates are al ready insoluble as is the title compound 5 and cannot be removed from the product mixture by further purification methods.",topology
