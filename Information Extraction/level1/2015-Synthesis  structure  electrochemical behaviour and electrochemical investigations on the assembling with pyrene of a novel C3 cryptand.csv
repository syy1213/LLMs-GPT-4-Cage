The formation of a host¨Cguest assembly between the investigated cryptand and pyrene was predicted by molecularmodelling and con?rmed by the electrochemical investigations by cyclic voltammetry using graphite electrodes.",affiliation

"Procedure : Triphenol 2(0.10 g; 0.28 mmol), com-pound 3(0.08 g; 0.42 mmol) and anhydrous NEt 3(0.14 mL; 0.98 mmol) were solved at r.t., under Ar andunder stirring in 10 mL DMSO. The temperature wasraised till 80 8C and the vigorous stirring was continued atthis temperature over night (12 h). The reaction mixturewas then cooled at r.t. and partitioned between ethylacetate(50 mL) and water (40 mL). The layers were separated andthe aqueous layer was then extracted three times withethylacetate (3 ¡ê20 mL). The combined organic layerswere washed with brine (50 mL), dried over Na2SO4,?ltered and concentrated in vacuum. Pure compound 1wasobtained by crystallisation from CH 2Cl2/EtOH ?1/1 as awhite solid (yields 28%; 0.08 g).",comprehensive synthesis
