"S3  (S)-1,3-Dibromobutane: (R)-Butane-1,3-diol (5.00 g, 55.0 mmol) was charged into a Schlenk flask and moisture was removed under low pressure for 10 min. Under a nitrogen atmosphere, liquid PBr3 (15.0 g, 5 mL, 110 mmol) was added slowly by syringe in an ice bath. The viscosity of the reaction mixture decreased during the addition process. Hydrogen bromide was discharged before heating the reaction mixture to 60 oC for 2 h. Upon cooling to 20 oC, iced water was added to quench the reaction, and hexane was used for extraction.

General Information Chemicals and solvents were purchased from commercial resources and used as received unless otherwise indicated. The purification of tetrahydrofuran was carried out under nitrogen by sodium. Synthesis and characterization of CSC-1 and CDC-1 were reported previsously.S1 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Advance III HD 400 or Bruker Advance III HD 500 spectrometer. MALDI-TOF MS spectrum was recorded on a solariX XR 7.0 T hybrid quadrupole-FTICR mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI/APCI/MALDI ion source (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany), using DCTB (10 mg/mL in CHCl3) as the matrix. Single Crystal X-ray data was collected on a Bruker D8 Venture diffractometer under 170 K.

"We previously developed a synthetic strategy to constructcatenane with two dissymmetric cages (CDC).14We startedfrom the catenane composed of two symmetric cages, namely,CSC-1 . As the inner cavity of CSC-1 is inaccessible byvoluminous NaBH(OAc)3, it allowed us to selectively reduceall imines on its exterior panels, leading to the formation ofCDC-1 .S i m i l a r l y , CDC-5 was produced by a two-stepprocedure. A [4 + 6] cycloimination reaction of four TFBpanels and six (4 R)-2-(3,5-di(3-aminophenyl)phenyl)-4-meth-yl-1,3-dithiane ( DAPMD ) linkers ?rst yielded CSC-5 . Thesubsequent selective reduction of the exterior imines of CSC-5by bulky reductant NaBH(OAc)3led to the formation ofCDC-5 (44% two-step overall yield, see the SupportingInformation for details). Its chemical structure was con ?rmedby MALDI-TOF and NMR spectroscopies, respectively(Figures S8 ?S12). The MALDI-TOF spectrum of CDC-5shows an ion peak at m/z2799.936 ([M + H]+calcd for2799.927), and its1H NMR spectrum exhibits the resonancesrelated to the exterior amine bonds (protons H b¡äand H n¡ä), theinterior imine bonds (proton Hs¡ä),TFB (protons Ha¡äand Hr¡ä),and two sets of DAPMD (typically protons H c¡ä?Hf¡ävs protonsHj¡ä?Hm¡ä), respectively.",topology
