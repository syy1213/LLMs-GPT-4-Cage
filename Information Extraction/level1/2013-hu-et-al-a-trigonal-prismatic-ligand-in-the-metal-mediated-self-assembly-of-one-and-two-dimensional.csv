El emental analysis were performed on an Elementar Vario EL instrument. Infrared spectra were collected on a Fourier Transform IR spectrometer (using KBr pellets). 1H and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded at 500 (500 MHz) or 400 (400 MHz) spectrom eters with TMS as the reference. Mass spectra (ESI analysis) were recorde d on a micrOTOFEQ spectrometer (LC/MS). Single crystal XEray diffraction data were  collected on a SMART APEX 2 XEray diffractometer equipped with a normal focus M oEtarget XEray tube (¦Ë = 0.71073 ?). Data reduction included absorption corrections by the multiEscan method. The structures were solved by direct methods and refine d by fullEmatrix leastEsquares using SHELXSE97. All nonEhydrogen atoms were refine d anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were added at their geometrically ideal posit ions and refined isotropically.",affiliation

Under self-assemblyconditions, single chain, double-stranded cross-linked coordi-nation polymer and two-dimensional (2D) coordinationpolymeric networks were formed via M-L(Ag+,C u2+, andZn2+) coordinative interactions. Structural analyses revealedthat the antiparallelly arranged one-dimensional coordinationpolymers (Cu2+and Zn2+) are arranged to generate well-de?ned voids to host aromatic guests (benzene) via C ?H¡¤¡¤¡¤¦Ðand¦Ð¡¤¡¤¡¤¦Ðinteractions, while the double-stranded cross-linkedcoordination polymer (Ag+) contains a rhomboidal [ Ag2(L3)2](L3: tridentate ligand) cage motif to include a benzene guest; the¡°thicker ¡±(thickness: ac5 ?) 2D coordination polymeric networks (Ag+,C u2+, and Zn2+), however, are all formed by connectionof one or two kinds of topologically di ?erent metallomacrocyclic cage units. These unique metallomacrocyclic cage units in the2D coordination polymeric networks are capable of hosting di ?erent guest species. For instance, the rhomboidal [ M2(L3)2]( M=Ag+,C u2+) cage units were found to host a benzene or a nitrate anion; a hexahedral [ M3(L3)3]( M=A g+) cage was found to hosta ligand Lor a DMF molecule; the hexahedral [ M4(L3)4]( M=C u2+) cage was found to host four solvent molecules of benzene;and the rectangular [ M3(L3)3]( M=C u2+,Z n2+) cage units, however, were found to host two THF molecules. The resultshighlight the potential of ligand Lfor applications in the construction of ¡°thicker ¡±2D coordination polymeric networks with well-de?ned metallomacrocyclic cage units capable of hosting various guest species.",this paper's author
