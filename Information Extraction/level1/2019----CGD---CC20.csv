Trifluoroacetic acid (10 米L) was added directly to this suspension followed by a solution of cis-1,3-cyclohexanediamine (432 mg, 3.78 mmol) dissolved in methanol/dichloromethane (1:1 v/v, 50 mL). The unstirred reaction was sealed and left to stand. Over a period of 14 days all of the solid 2-hydroxy-1,3,5-triformylbenzene was consumed, and crystals grew on the inner sides of the round bottom flask. The yellow solution was gradually exchanged with n-pentane then the crystals were soaked in n-pentane for a further 7 days.

"*SSupporting InformationABSTRACT: Porous organic cages have emerged over thelast 10 years as a subclass of functional microporous materials.However, among all of the organic cages reported, largemulticomponent organic cages with 20 components or moreare still rare. Here, we present an [8 + 12] porous organicimine cage, CC20 , which has an apparent surface area up to1752 m2g?1, depending on the crystallization and activationconditions. The cage is solvatomorphic and displays distinctgeometrical cage structures, caused by crystal-packing e ?ects,in its crystal structures. This indicates that larger cages candisplay a certain range of shape ?exibility in the solid state, while remaining shape persistent and porous.",surface area
"In comparison with the [4 + 6] cage synthesized by Petryket al., the larger CC20 must be desolvated more carefullybefore gas sorption. The as-synthesized Pm3 structure is poorlycrystalline after the reaction solvent is removed from the pores,and this phase was found to be nonporous to N2afterdesolvation under vacuum at 90 ～C(Figure 2 andFigures S8 ?S10). However, careful desolvation of the n-pentane activatedIm3 phase under a ?ow of nitrogen followed by vacuum atambient temperature a ?orded a porous phase ( Figure 2 andFigures S11 and S12 ). In contrast, drying the pentane solvatein air for 2 days results in loss of crystallinity ( Figure S13 ). Thecarefully desolvated sample was found to be porous with anSABETvalue of 829 m2/g. However, after activation and postgas sorption, PXRD patterns indicate that this materialtransforms after the n-pentane is removed from the crystalstructure ( Figure S11 ).",surface area
"The as-crystallized P1 CHCl3/MeCN phase was carefullyactivated by initially exchanging the crystallization solvent withn-pentane and then by heating this P1n-pentane solvate at 30～C under vacuum. After activation using these conditions, wefound that this phase performed better in terms of structuralstability and it remained crystalline after gas-sorption analysis,according to PXRD measurements ( Figure S14 ). Thermogra-vimetric analysis (TGA) also indicates that the CC20 material,crystallized and activated using the same conditions, is stableand crystalline up to 300 ～C, when it is heated under N2Figure 1.

Growth Des. 2019, 19, 3647 ?36513649(Figures S15 and S16 ). The SA BETvalue for this phase was1752 m2/g, which is one of the higher values reported so far forPOCs ( Figure 2 andFigure S17 ); the current record is 3758m2/g,7but the vast majority of POCs have SABETvalues <1000m2/g.6The desolvated P1 phase also shows a large xenonuptake of 3.44 mmol/g at 1 bar and 273 K; by comparison, thesmaller [4 + 6] CC3 has a Xe uptake of 2.69 mmol/g at 1 barand 298 K ( Figures S17 and S18 ), but unlike CC3,CC20 doesnot appear to be saturated at 1 bar Xe pressure.8Di?erences were observed between the simulated PXRDpatterns of the Im n -pentane solvate and the P1 solvates, incomparison to the PXRD patterns recorded after desolvationand gas sorption analysis, indicating that the cage structurestransform further during these processes ( Figures S19 andS20). This is likely due to changes in the shape of CC20 upondesolvation and/or reorientation of the cages in the crystallattice. We ascribe this to the ※shape ?exibility §exhibited byCC20 and the spherical nature of this cage. We have previouslyfound that smaller spherical cages can be highly solvatomor-phic37and di ?cult to desolvate without pronounced structuraltransformations.",surface area
"13←SUMMARYIn conclusion, by increasing the bond angle between thereactive functionality on one of the starting materials, we havesuccessfully synthesized a new [8 + 12] cage, CC20 , by iminecondensation. CC20 was observed to form several solvato-morphs by SCXRD, which contain a number of distinctlyshaped cages due to crystal-packing e ?ects. To the best of ourknowledge, this is the ?rst time that a ※shape-persistent §POChas displayed ?exibility in the solid state. The formation of thelarge CC20 was found to be more sensitive to the synthesisconditions than its smaller analogue, and the stabilizing e ?ectsof hydroxyl groups were required to form the cage. CC20exhibits a very high SABETvalue of 1752 m2/g, which is amongthe highest reported for an organic molecular solid.←ASSOCIATED CONTENT*SSupporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge on theACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.cgd.8b01761 .",surface area

Here, we report the synthesis of anexpanded analogue of this cage, synthesized using cis-1,3-cyclohexanediamine ( cis-1,3-CHDA) in place of the homo-chiral trans-1,2-CHDA that was used in the synthesis of thesmaller cage. The increase in the bond angle between theamines in the cis-1,3-CHDA results in a change in cagetopology from a 10-component tetrahedral [4 + 6] cage to a20-component cubic [8 + 12] cage ( Scheme 1 ).",topology
"←RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCC20 was obtained by the self-assembly of 8 molecules of 2-hydroxy-1,3,5-triformylbenzene (HO-TFB) with 12 moleculesofcis-1,3-CHDA. CC20 is similar in composition to therecently reported [4 + 6] cage, synthesized from HO-TFB andhomochiral trans -1,2-CHDA.",topology
"Initial attempts to synthesize a cis-1,3-CHDA-containingcage focused on reacting the diamine with 1,3,5-triformylben-zene (TFB). However, multiple experimental attempts (usingdi?erent solvents, concentrations, and stirring rates)35all gavecomplex product mixtures by1H NMR, alongside an insolublewhite precipitate. It has been reported that the introduction ofa suitably positioned hydroxyl group can aid the formation ofcage product.36With this in mind, we switched from usingTFB to HO-TFB. HO-TFB was recently reported by Petryk etal. to form a [4 + 6] cage by reaction with chiral trans-1,2-CHDA ( Scheme 1 ). On mixing solutions of cis-1,3-CHDAwith HO-TFB in DCM/MeOH, an insoluble yellowprecipitate was formed initially. After the reaction mixturestood for 1 week, crystals began to grow on the walls of the?ask. During optimization of the experimental conditions, itwas found that layering a dilute solution of the cis-1,3-CHDAonto solid HO-TFB, without stirring, avoided the formation ofthe initial insoluble precipitate; a small amount of TFA wasalso observed to catalyze the reaction. After 2 weeks, a yellowcrystalline product formed on the inner wall of the ?ask, thistime without any insoluble coprecipitate.",topology

Thus, these two conformations of thecage are not distinct minima when the molecule is consideredin isolation and their presence is likely due to crystal-packinge?ects in the solid state. This suggests that there is some?exibility in the cage, although computational modelingsupported by experimental porosity measurements alsosuggests that the cage remains shape-persistent upon desolva-tion.",topology
"22,23Previous e ?orts toward thepreparation of new organic cages have tended to focus onthe assembly, via reversible reactions, of one24or two distinctstarting materials into cages that comprise fewer than 20subunits. The synthesis of larger multicomponent organiccages with high surface areas and large pore volume is rare. Todate, Warmuth,25,26Mastalerz,7,27Gawronski,28Beuerle,29,30and our group31have successfully obtained large organic cagesfrom at least 20 subunits. However, with the exception ofMastalerz ’s [8 + 12] boronic ester cages,7,27none of these largecages exhibits permanent porosity in the solid state. This couldbe due to collapse of the desolvated cages as a cumulativee?ect of limited rotation in multiple “rigid ”bonds.",topology
"1H and13C NMR,di?usion NMR, and high-resolution mass spectrometry wereconsistent with the formation of an [8 + 12] cage ( Figures S1 ?S5). The successful outcome of this reaction suggests that thehydroxyl group on the aromatic ring is required to stabilize thegeometrical structure of the [8 + 12] cage intermediates byforming salicylic imines with intramolecular hydrogenbondingin the absence of hydroxyl groups, this [8 + 12]cage did not form.",topology
"Four solvated single-crystal structures of CC20 wereidenti ?ed. Directly from the synthesis in CH2Cl2and MeOHwe obtained large solvated crystals ( Figure S7 ) with cubic Pm3symmetry. In the Pm3 structure, there are two crystallo-graphically distinct CC20 conformers ( Figure 1 a,b). Whileboth CC20 conformers have open cuboctahedral shapes,comparable to the shape of the [8 + 12] cage reported byGawronski,28one of the cage conformers has an ellipticalshape, which elongates the cage windows ( Figure 1 a).CC20does not have bulky tert-butyl substituents on the vertices likethe Gawronski cage. In the CC20 Pm3 structure, the cages arepacked ine ?ciently window to window, resulting in theformation of large interconnected extrinsic voids ( Figure 1 c).",topology
