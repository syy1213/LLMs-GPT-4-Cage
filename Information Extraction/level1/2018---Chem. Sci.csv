"45¨C54Since palladium-mediated catalysis has been widelyapplied and shown great synthetic power in current organicchemistry,55as a proof-of-principle, we chose to use one of themost popular carbon ¨Ccarbon (C ¨CC) bond formation reactions,the Suzuki ¨CMiyaura cross-coupling reaction, to evaluate thecatalytic activity of PdNP@ 3a. The coupling reactions werecarried out using phenylboronic acid (1.5 equiv.) and PdNP@ 3a(0.01 equiv.) along with various aryl iodides and aryl bromidesbearing a variety of functional groups. All reactions were per-formed in a mixture of toluene/H2O (10 : 1, v/v) using Na 2CO3(3equiv.) as a base. The catalytic activity of PdNP@ 3awas¬èrstinvestigated using phenylboronic acid and aryl iodides at 100/C14Cunder microwave heating (Table 1, entries 1 and 2). The reac-tion progress was monitored viaTLC and the crude reactionmixtures were analyzed by1H NMR spectroscopy. Althoughconversion was good a «àer 10 ¨C15 minutes of reaction, we foundthat increasing the reaction time to 30 minutes gave almostquantitative yields. To broaden the scope of the PdNP@ 3acatalyst, the same conditions were applied to a series of arylbromide substrates using a temperature of 140/C14C. We obtainedthe desired coupling products in almost quantitative yields inmost entries. The analysis of the crude reaction mixture by1HNMR shows little evidence of impurity formation during thecoupling except in entry 5, which was seen to contain 1 ¨C2%biphenyl by-product.",comprehensive synthesis

Materials and general methods All commercially available reagents and solvents were used as received, unless noted otherwise.  CH2Cl2 and toluene were purified by MBRAUN solvent purification system.  All reactions were carried out under dry nitrogen in flame dried glassware, unless noted otherwise.  After workup, all solvents were removed by rotary evaporator.  Unless other indicated, the purity of the compounds was ¡Ý 95 % based on 1H NMR spectral integration.

Palladium nanoparticle growth  All reactions were carried out on a 4-8 mg scale with respect to cage 3a.

The mixture was stirred until all Pd(II) was transferred into organic phase (~25 min).  A solution of cage 3a (4.0 mg, 0.0011 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (0.5 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred at rt for 30-45 min and then subsequently reduced with an aqueous solution of NaBH4 (8.0 mg, 0.21 mmol) in deionized H2O (0.5 mL).  The resulting organic layer had the characteristic dark color of PdNP and contained no precipitate.  After S8		separation, the aqueous layer was washed with CH2Cl2 (2 x 1 mL). The organic fractions were combined and concentrated to ca. 0.2 mL without the application of heat.  The remaining organic solution (0.2 mL) was then transferred dropwise to a solution of ethanol (5-10 mL) to induce the precipitation of PdNP@3a complexes. The precipitates were separated by filtration.  The resulting complexes are soluble in common organic solvents and stable in solution at room temperature.",comprehensive synthesis
