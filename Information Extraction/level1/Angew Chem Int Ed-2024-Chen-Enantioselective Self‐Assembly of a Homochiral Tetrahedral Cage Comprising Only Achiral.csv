"Todecipher theunderlying mechanisms ofthisnaturalenigma,chemists endeavor toself-assemble chiralmoleculesexclusively fromnonchiral precursors. However, intheabsenceofanychiralinfluences, theresulting self-assembledproducts areeitherachiral[3]orracemic mixtures.[4]Onefrequently employed approach istheintroduction ofchiralsolvents[5]orguests.[6]Thesetwoenantiomers ofaself-assembled product become chemically biased,leadingtoenantiomeric selectivity orpureformations.

"A 1:3 mixture of 1a (2 mg, 0.004 mmol) and (1 S,2S)-2-aminocyclohexanol ( S-3l) (1.38 mg, 0.012 mmol) was combined in CDCl 3 (0.6 mL) ( Scheme S1 ). The corresponding reaction mixtures were stirred at 25 °„C for 8 h.  1H NMR spectra ( Figure S1a) indicated the formation of S-4l as the major product.  Subsequently, tris(2 -aminoethyl)amine (TREN) (0.58 mg, 0.004 mmo) was added to the above reaction solution. The mixtures were stirred at room temperature for 8 h, yielding to the formation of 2a and release of S-3l via imine exchange . The 1H NMR ( Figure S1b ) and MS s pectra  (Figure S2 ) of 2a are consistent with our previous publication, both confirming the formation of the tetrahedral cage[1a].",comprehensive synthesis
"In contrast, a fter addition of three  equivalent s of S-3l (1.73 mg, 0.015 mmol) to the solution of 2a, the latter  remained intact without observable imine exchange  (Figure S3b).",comprehensive synthesis
"A 1:1:3 mixture of 1a (3 mg, 0.005 mmol), TREN (0.78 mg, 0.005 mmol ) and S-3l (1.73 mg, 0.015 mmol)  was combined  simultaneously  in CDCl 3 (0.6 mL) ( Scheme S2). After stirring the corresponding solutions at room temperature for 8 h, the 1H NMR spectrum was recorded ( Figure S 4), indicating  that the presence of S-3l did not interrupt the formation of  the cage 2a.",comprehensive synthesis
