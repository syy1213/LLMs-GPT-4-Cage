Thelayers were separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted withCH2Cl2(2/H11003). The combined extract was washed with H 2O andbrine and dried with MgSO 4. The crude product was obtained asa yellow residue after solvent removal under reduced pressure andwas purified by flash column chromatography to give, after dryingin vacuo, the formylated products.",comprehensive synthesis
