"Results and DiscussionMaterial synthesis and characterizationAccording to our previous report,54,55the FPPOC wassynthesized through dynamic imine chemistry of tri(fu-ran-2-yl) phosphine-based trialdehyde and [( S,S)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine]. Brie ?y, a 2:3 stoichiometric ratioof trialdehyde and diamine was stirred at 40 ∼C in dichlor-omethane (DCM)/MeOH (1:1, v/v) for 5 days to afford apale-yellow solid after recrystallization in methanol(Figure 1aandSupporting Information Scheme S1 ). Theformation of the [2 + 3] assembled molecular cagewas unambiguously con ?rmed by1H/13C/31P NMR, elec-trospray ionization mass spectroscopy analysis, andFourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( SupportingInformation Figures S2 每S9). The solid FPPOC is bench-stable and insoluble in strong polar solvents (e.g.,alcohol, H 2O), but is soluble in DCM or DCM-MeOHmixture while maintaining the prefabricated skeletonstructure. Thermogravimetric analysis demonstrates thatFPPOC has a good thermal stability ( SupportingInformation Figure S10 ). Pd NCs supported on FPPOC(named as Pd@FPPOC) was prepared via a typicalimpregnation-reduction process using Pd(OAc) 2as Pdsource and sodium borohydride (NaBH 4) as thereductant.54To clearly characterize the structure of the obtainedmaterial, comprehensive characterizations were per-formed. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM)image (Figure 1b) shows that ultra ?ne Pd NCs ( ‵2.4 nm)with a narrow size distribution were uniformly dispersedon the surface of FPPOC. Given that the cavity size ofFPPOC54is signi ?cantly smaller than that of Pd NCs, PdNCs are mainly on the outside of the cage cavity. Thehigh-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image (Figure 1c)resolves a characteristic lattice fringe with d spacing of0.222 nm, which corresponds to the (111) plane of atypical metallic Pd face-centered cubic (fcc) structure,a high-angle annular dark- ?eld scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) image, and the corresponding energy-dispersiveX-ray mapping images (Figure 1d) verify that C, N, P, O,and Pd elements were homogeneously distributed with-out any sign of agglomeration, which is supportive of theexcellent dispersity of ultra ?ne Pd NCs in the FPPOCagain. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Figure 2a) showa broad diffraction peak centered at 20∼ for the as-synthesized FPPOC, while a less intensive peak at 40.1∼was detected in Pd@FPPOC, which is indexed to the (111)lattice plane of metallic Pd (JCPDS# 46-1043) with a fccstructure, and is consistent with TEM observation. Thisobservation indicates that Pd NCs are successfully load-ed. The Pd loading amount of Pd@FPPOC was deter-mined to be 19.3 wt % by inductively coupled plasmaoptical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Hence, a mo-lecular cage with high Pd loading content of ultra ?ne NCsand uniform distribution was successfully prepared.",topology
