"Low scattering power of the crystal enabled us to locate only three of the highly disordered water molecules belonging to the first  hydrati on sphere of the molecule. These were the water molecules that act as fasteners of the cage c onstruction. The remaining solvent molecules could not be easily located and refined. Therefore, we  have corrected the observed data by using the SQUEEZE routine in PLATON.[2] We ha ve found 2927 electrons in 9080 A3, which means that around 53% of the unit cell is filled with diso rdered solvent molecules.  After that we were able to refine the structure to R values of  R1=0.076 and wR2 (all data)=0.240. Atomic coordinates have been deposited at the Camb ridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC 909668).",CCDC
