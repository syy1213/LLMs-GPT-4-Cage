"A total of 8284  reflections were collected, of  which 2701 were  unique.  Final R 1(I > 2¦Ò(I)) =  0.1412 and wR 2 = 0.4399 (all data). The structure was solved by direct method and different Fourier syntheses. Using Olex2, the structure was solved with the  ShelXT structure solution  program using  Intrinsic  Phasing and refined with the  ShelXL refinement package  using  Least  Squares minimization. The SQUEEZE procedure  was done(see details in the cif  file).  The quality of the crystal is limited  due to its easy collapse. CCDC number:  2058306.",CCDC
"Combining 1,3,5-tri(furan-2-yl) benzene ( TFB) (1.5 mM) andacetone (6.75 mM) in anhydrous dichloromethane at 298 K inthe presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, namely SnCl4, a cylinder-shaped macrocycle 1was obtained as the major product after72 h. Performing chromatographic purification yielded pure 1in 36% (Table 1, entry 10) yield, which is soluble in a variety oforganic solvents, including DCM, chloroform and THF.A variety of other acid catalysts including FeCl3, AlCl 3,B F 3/C1OEt 2, TFA, H 2SO4, and HCl, were also screened. Using Br?nstedacids such as TFA, H 2SO4, and HCl as the catalysts led to noreaction. While using FeCl 3and BF 3/C1OEt 2led to intractableprecipitates that were not dissolved in the most commonly usedsolvent. We reasonably assume that these precipitates arepolymeric products. 1was produced in low yields in the caseof AlCl3(i.e., 5%¨C8%). Such comparisons indicate that SnCl 4isthe best catalyst for the formation of 1.

After the reaction reached its equilibrium after 72 h, the  reaction  mixture was  poured into cold water (100 mL),  which was extracted with DCM  (40 mL ¢ª 2).  The organic  layer was  washed with saturated aqueous  solution of NaHCO 3 (100 mL)  and brine water  (100 mL).  After drying  with Na 2SO 4, the solvent was  removed under  vacuum.
