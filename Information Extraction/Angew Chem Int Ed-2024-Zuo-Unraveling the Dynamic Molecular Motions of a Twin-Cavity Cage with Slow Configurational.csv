However, their structural complexity presents formidable challenge in elucidating their kinetics, especially when multiple structural motions are intercorrelated. We herein introduce a twin-cavity cage that features interconvertible C3- and C1-configurations, each configuration exhibiting interchangeable P- and M-conformations. This molecule is therefore composed of four interconnected chiral species (P)-C3, (M)-C3, (P)-C1, (M)-C1. We showcase an effective methodology to decouple these sophisticated structural changes into two kinetically distinct pathways. Utilizing time-dependent 1H NMR spectroscopy at various temperatures, which disregards the transition between mirror-image conformations, we first determine the rate constant (kc) for C3- to C1-configuration interconversion; while time-dependent circular dichroism spectroscopy at different temperatures quantifies the observed rate constant (kobs) of ensemble of all structural changes. As kobs >> kc, it allows us to decouple the overall molecular motions into a slow configurational transformation and rapid conformational interconversions, the latter further dissected into two independent 10.1002/anie.202405858Accepted ManuscriptAngewandte Chemie International EditionThis article is protected by copyright.

Materials Reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification, unless other indicated. 1-(3,5-Dibromophenyl)ethanone, (3-((tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino)phenyl)boronic acid and catalysts tetrakis-(triphenylphosphine)-palladium [Pd(PPh3)4] and [1,1＊-bis(diphenylphosphino)-ferrocene]dichloropalladium(II) [Pd(dppf)Cl2] were purchased from Bidepharm, China. Bis(pinacolato)diboron ((Bpin)2), 1,3-dibromobenzene, phloroglucinol, formamidine acetate, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), scandium(III) trifluoromethanesulfonate [Sc(OTf)3] were purchased from Adamas-beta, China. Thionylchloride (SOCl2), and inorganic salts including potassium carbonate, potassium acetate, sodium bicarbonate and magnesium sulfate were purchased from Greagent, China. Flash column chromatography was performed on silica gel (200每300 mesh) and the compounds were visualized under 254 nm on thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates.  2. Techniques 2.1 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker A VANCE III HD 400, Bruker AVANCE III HD 500, or Bruker A VANCE NEO 700 NMR spectrometer. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured at 298.15 K in CDCl3, C2D2Cl4 or DMSO-d6. Their proton and 13carbon residuals are used as internal references for 1H and 13C NMR, respectively. Proton chemical shifts (汛) are reported in ppm and coupling constants (J) in Hertz (Hz). The multiplicity in the 1H NMR spectra are described as s (singlet); d (doublet); dd (doublet of doublets); t (triplet); q (quartet); m (multiplet); br (broad). Time-dependent 1H NMR spectra were recorded in C2D2Cl4 at different temperatures on a Bruker AVANCE III HD 500 spectrometer with different time intervals. Quantitative 13C NMR spectrum was measured in C2D2Cl4 at 298.15 K on a Bruker AVANCE NEO 700 NMR spectrometer, employing 1024 scans and a relaxation delay (D1) of 15 s following the addition of relaxation reagent chromium(III) acetylacetonate. S4  2.2 Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometry MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed on a Bruker Autoflex speed TOF/TOF mass spectrometer and operated in reflective mode. Internal calibration was performed using peptide (700?3500 Dalton) as standards. The analytical samples were obtained by mixing the CHCl3 solution of the sample (5 mg mL?1) and CH2Cl2 solution of the matrix (trans-2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propene]-malononitrile (DCTB, 10 mg mL?1) in a 1/5 (v/v) ratio. The prepared mixture solution of the sample (1 米L) was loaded on the MALDI-TOF plate and allowed to dry at room temperature before the plate was inserted into the vacuum chamber of the MALDI-TOF instrument. 2.3 Single Crystal X-Ray Diffractometry (SC-XRD) The single crystal data of configuration-1 of Diphane-5 was collected on Bruker D8 VENTURE. The structure was solved by direct methods using the OLEX-2 software. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined using anisotropic thermal parameters. The refined single crystal data are listed in Table S10. 2.4 Circular Dichroism (CD) Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was performed with a JASCO J-1500 spectrometer. Time-dependent CD spectra were performed in C2D2Cl4 at various temperatures and different time intervals, utilizing 1 mm quartz cuvettes. The experimental conditions included a scan rate of 500 nm﹞min?1, a response time of 1 s and a bandwidth of 5 nm.  2.5 Density Functional Theory (DFT) All calculations were executed using the Gaussian 16 A.03 program[S1] with default procedures, algorithms and integration grids. The initial structure, derived from single crystal analysis, underwent optimization employing the hybrid functional B3LYP[S2?S5] coupled with the 6-31G(d,p) basis level.[S6?S8]  To determine the valid thermodynamic potential for different isomers (at 298.15 K, 1.0 atm), we conducted vibrational frequency calculations using optimized molecular S5  geometry, simulating the solvent 1,2-dichloroethane within the SMD framework. Specifically, frequency calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level[S6?S8]. Additionally, to identify possible transition states during the interconversion between the C3- and C1-configurations resulting from the rotation of the carbon-carbon bond, we conducted transition state searches by employing the Berny geometry optimization algorithm from various possible starting structures at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level.[S6?S8] In these calculations, the solvent chloroform was also simulated within the SMD framework. To ensure consistency with UV-Vis absorption and CD experiments, ground state optimizations and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations were conducted, simulating the solvent 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane with 1,2-dichloroethane (汍 = 10.36) as a solvent within the Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM) framework.[S9] The calculated frontier orbitals of Diphane-5 are displayed in Figure S31. Frequency calculations were performed with no imaginary frequency found for the optimized molecular geometry. TD-DFT calculations were conducted using optimized molecular geometry, considering the first 50 transitions (singlet:triplet = 50:50). The solvent 1,2-dichloroethane was simulated within PCM framework. Specifically, TD-DFT calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level.[S10] Electronic transitions were visualized using GaussSum 3.0,[S11] setting the full width half maximum (FWHM) to 2500 cm?1 for predicted UV-vis absorption spectra, and the 考 value is set to 0.5 eV for predicted CD spectra. Excited state hole-electron analysis was carrying out using Multiwfn 3.8 (dev).[S12]  3. Synthesis of Precursors and Diphane-5 The syntheses of all chemical compounds are described as follows. Diphane-5 was synthesized by the condensation of aldehyde and amide and following keto-enol tautomerization according to our previous literature.[S13] 2,4,6-Trihydroxybenzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde (TP), tris(N-salicylideneaniline) (TSAN) and 1,3,5-tris(3,5-dibromophenyl)benzene (compound 1) were synthesized according to the literature S6  procedure.[S14?S16] 1H and 13C NMR spectra of all compounds are listed after their synthetic procedures and proton assignments are given in corresponding spectra in Section 4 and 12.",this paper's author
