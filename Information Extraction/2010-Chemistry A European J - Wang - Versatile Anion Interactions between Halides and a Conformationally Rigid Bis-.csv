A mixture of 4 and tetraethylammonium halide (1 : 4.5 molar ratio) was dissolved in dichloromethane. n-Hexane was then added until the solution became turbid. A small amount of dichloromethane was then added to  give a clear solution. Slow evaporation of the solvents at room temperature afforded single crystals of the host-halide complex suitable to X-ray diffraction analysis.,comprehensive synthesis

As proposed by Hayand his co-workers,[3]interaction of an anion with a aromaticpsystem leads to either a noncovalent anion每 pcomplex A,a weak s-complex B, or the Meisenheimer intermediate C.A number of experimental studies[4]have demonstrated in-teractions between anions and psystems; however, experi-mental evidence to support ※pure§ anion每 pinteractionswith charge-neutral arenes is very rare.[3,5]Indeed, a recentreport indicated that the noncovalent anion每 pinteractioncontributes less significantly to the formation of chloride每 p-C6FnH6/C0ncomplex.[6]Heteroatom-bridged calixaromatics are an emerging typeof novel macrocyclic molecules and they exhibit unique andversatile structural and molecular recognition properties.",this paper's author
