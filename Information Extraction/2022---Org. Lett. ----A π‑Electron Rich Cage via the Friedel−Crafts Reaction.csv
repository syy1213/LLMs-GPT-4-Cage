"5¡¢Synthesis of cage 11,3,5-tri(furan-2-yl) benzene (2) (200 mg, 0.72 mmol) and 1,4-diisopropenylbenzene (3) (178 mg, 1.125 mmol) were dissolved in 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) (50 mL). Ca(NTf 2)2 (108.07 mg, 0.18 mmol) and NBu 4PF6 (69.74 mg, 0.18 mmol) was added to the solution. The reaction mixture was stirred under reflux at 85 ?C in an oil bath. The reaction progress was monitored by TLC. After the reaction reached its equilibrium after 16 h, the reaction mixture was poured into water (50 mL), which was extracted with 40 mL DCM three times. The organic layer was collected and then washed with brine (50 mL). After dried with Na 2SO 4, the solvent was removed under vacuum. The crude product was further purified by column chromatography on silica gel (DCM/petroleum ether = 1:3) to yield cage 1 as an off-white powder (148 mg, 40%).",comprehensive synthesis
