"[4c]Despite therichness in imine chemistry,[16]these are the only fewexamples where transformations have been exploited topost-stabilize organic cage compounds under the conserva-tion/retention of porosity.[17,18]Here we present our results on transforming a [4 +6]salicylimine cage directly (without the necessity of protectingthe phenolic hydroxy groups) into a quinoline cage bya twelve-fold Povarov reaction[19,20]with subsequent oxidation(Scheme 1). The quinoline cage 2was synthesized by treatingthe imine cage 1[7f]in neat phenylacetylene as the solvent,with scandium triflate (3.6 equiv) as the Lewis acid andchloranil (12 equiv) as the oxidant. After heating at 1008C for20 hours, and after removal of by-products by columnchromatography the cage was isolated in 25% yield. It isworth mentioning that this corresponds to 89% per iminebond, which is even higher than we were able to realize for thebisquinoline model compound 3(here the yield was 35% andper imine bond 59%.

"[4a,11]Nevertheless, with a follow-up reaction, porosity can berecovered. This has been exemplified, for example, forCooper/C29s smaller [4+6] amine cages where the reducedamine cage contains 1,2-diamine units, which form aminalswith aldehydes or ketones.[12]Another similar approach is thefixation of the corresponding amines of [2 +3] salicyl iminecages[13]as carbamates.[14]Recently, our group demonstratedthat the twelve imine bonds of a rigid shape-persistent [4 +6]salicylimine cage can be transformed by Pinnick oxidationsinto chemically much more robust amide bonds with reten-tion of the shape persistency.[15]Indeed, this amide cage wasstable in a slightly broader pH range ( /C01 to 14.5) than, forexample, the carbamate cage ( /C01 to 14).[14]This unprece-dented stability opened the possibility for further chemicalderivatization under harsh reaction conditions, such asselective twelve-fold bromination or nitration, occurring inyields greater than 80%. Unfortunately, the Pinnick reactiondoes not work in the presence of the phenolic hydroxy group,so that the six hydroxy groups of the salicylimine cage neededto be first transformed into methyl ethers.",topology

"The chemical and thermal stability of the compound wastested. A sample was heated to 350 8C and showed, aftercooling to room temperature, no difference in the1H NMRspectrum. Still, the MS showed only the peak of the quinolinecage at m/z=3418 with its characteristic isotopic distributionpattern. Neither under very harsh acidic conditions (concen-trated sulfuric acid, pH /C01.9), nor under harsh basicconditions (concentrated NaOH, pH 15.2) does the com-pound decompose. The nearly quantitative recovered mate-rial was neutralized and the recorded1H NMR spectra againshowed no difference to the compound before treatment. Thisrange is to the best of our knowledge, the largest pH windowin which a shape-persistent organic cage is stable (forcomparison the [4+6] amide cage is pH-stable from /C01t o14.5).[15]It is worth mentioning that 1decomposes at pH 3 orbeyond pH 11 (see the Supporting Information).",topology
"In contrast to the previously reported [4 +6] amide cage,the extended fused aromatic quinoline units allowed us tostudy the acidochromism of this cage. By the naked eye,a clear color change is detected both in the solid state and insolution. Under basic or pH neutral conditions the compoundis pale yellow, whereas when acidic it is bright red to orange(Figure 7). Because 2is well soluble in CHCl3and CH2Cl2,(>130 mgmL/C01) and also in THF or toluene (approx.",topology
"To summarize, a chemically and thermally very robustshape-persistent quinoline cage has been synthesized in 25%yield by a twelve-fold Povarov reaction of a [4+6] salicyliminecage with phenylacetylene. In contrast to prior post function-alizations of this and other imine cages,[14,15,29]this conversionwas achieved in one step. The quinoline cage shows a charac-teristic acidochromism, which was used in combination withits solubility to generate thin-films for sensing of either acid orbase vapors.",topology
