"10,17In morerecent studies using high-throughput robotics to automate thesynthesis of scrambled POC mixtures,18it was found that mixturesof vicinal diamines did not always lead to the formation of astatistical distribution of cage species. In particular, one combi-nation involving 2-methylpropane -1,2-diamine (MPDA, used in thesynthesis of CC13 ,191 equiv.) and (3 R,4R)-2,5-dimethylhexane-3,4-diamine (DMHDA, 5 equiv.) led to t he isolation of a novel isopropyldecorated parent cage, CC21 , albeit in a low 5% yield (Fig. 1a).18When the direct synthesis of CC21 was then attempted using6 equivalents of DMHDA in CHCl 3,a n di nt h ea b s e n c eo fM P D A ,the parent cage was not isolated. In stead, an alternative tri-aminalside-product (1,3,5-tris(4,5-diisop ropyl-imidazolidin-2-yl)benzene,Fig. 1b) was formed and isolated in 33% yield. These preliminaryresults prompted us to carry out further investigations into theformation of CC21 . Here, we report the synthesis, characterisation,and investigation into the formation and properties of this newPOC, which proved to be both highly soluble and have unusualcrystal packing, likely due to the presence of the sterically bulkyisopropyl functionalities on the cage vertices.aDepartment of Chemistry and Materials Innovation Factory, University ofLiverpool, 51 Oxford Street, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK.E-mail: aicooper@liverpool.ac.ukbDepartment of Chemistry, Molecular Sciences Research Hub, Imperial CollegeLondon, 82 Wood Lane, London, W12 0BZ, UK.E-mail: r.greenaway@imperial.ac.uk?Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Full computational,experimental and characterisation details.

The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023under these conditions, we determined the structure of a newphase, CC21a , which is structurally related to CC21/C1 CHCl 3/C1MeOH but has a unit cell volume that is 15% smaller (ESI, ?Table S2) due to a denser packing of CC21 molecules. Notably,the PXRD pattern for the activated bulk sample crystallisedfrom CH2Cl2matches the simulated PXRD of CC21a (ESI, ?Fig. S23), and we used this sample for N 2gas sorptionanalysis at 77.3 K (ESI, ?Fig. S24). CC21a was found to adsorb11.1 mmol g/C01of N 2at 1 bar and 77.3 K, and has a BrunauerÃ¿EmmettÃ¿Teller (BET) surface area of 699 m2g/C01. PXRD datarecorded post gas sorption analysis revealed that CC21a did notchange structure during this measurement (ESI, ?Fig. S23),indicating that the bulky isopropyl groups do not affect thestability of the activated material. This data also proves thatCC21 is shape persistent in the solid state and retains its cavityin the absence of solvent. Computational assessment of theporosity of the obtained crystal structure suggests that channelsthrough the structure are approximately the size of an N2molecule, which allows for nitrogen adsorption (ESI, ?Fig. S29).",surface area

The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023First, a series of1H NMR experiments were carried outprobing the neat reaction between TFB and DMHDA, and thereaction in the presence of the ditopic amine MPDA or a mono-amine, namely isobutylamine, which would avoid the for-mation of a competing cage and avoid the risk of scramblingoccurring (ESI, ?Fig. S1, S3 and S5). The reaction mixtures werealso analysed by high-resolution mass-spectrometry (HRMS) atdi?erent time points to aid in the identification of key reactionintermediates (ESI, ?Fig. S2, S4 and S6). In each of the condi-tions investigated, no insoluble precipitate formed over thecourse of the reaction, and common intermediates formedfrom the reaction of TFB with DMHDA could be identifiedand persisted throughout the reactions (Fig. 2 and ESI, ?Tables S1, S5, Fig. S7) Ã¿ these included [1+2], [1+3], [2+3],[2+4], [3+4], [3+5], and [3+6] intermediates ([TFB + DMHDA])with varying degrees of condensation and water loss.
