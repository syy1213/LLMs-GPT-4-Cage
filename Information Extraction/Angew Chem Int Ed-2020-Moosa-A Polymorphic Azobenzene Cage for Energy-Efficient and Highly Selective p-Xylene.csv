"13C NMR shows two peaks at the aliphatic region 57.8 and52.5 ppm which are assigned to the cage carbons, while thefive aromatic peaks representing the imine bond are seen at161.4 ppm and 153®C123 (Figure S2). Initially, other than beingan excellent recognition unit, including the azo group in thecage was intended to control the pore cavity with light/heat.Exposing the AZO-Cage in solution (in CDCl3)t oU V[*] B.

"2  Hydrogen atoms were placed in the geometrically calculated positions and refined using riding models with isotropic thermal parameters Uiso(H) = 1.2Ueq(C). Powder XRD (PXRD)  Routine powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were collected using Cu K¶¡ radiation (¶À = 1.5418 ?, 40 kV and 30 mA) on a PANalytical X°Øpert PRO instrument operating in Bragg-Brentano geometry. Intensity data were recorded using an X°ØCelerator detector, and 2¶» scans in the range of 4?40°„ were performed with a step size of 0.02°„ at a scan speed of 0.02 (°„/s). The sample was placed in a zero-background sample holder and normal configuration of the instrument was used.  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)   NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 500 MHz. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm relative to the signals corresponding to the residual non-deuterated solvents. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)  Thermogravimetric analysis was carried out using an automatic sample loading TA Instruments Q5000 analyzer. The instrument records weight loss as a function of temperature. It was used to determine onset temperature and temperature ranges of the guest loss and sample degradation. Usually a sample of 0.5-4 mg was heated starting at room temperature to 1000 °„C in a standard TA instrument aluminum pan at a heating rate of 10 K min-1. Samples were analyzed under constant flow of dry nitrogen gas at a flow rate of 50 ml min-1. TGA traces were analyzed and figures generated using OriginLab 2019. Xylene Selectivity Studies in Vapor To study the xylene vapor kinetics on AZO-Cages, samples of 10 mg were exposed to 95% relative pressure of each xylene vapor for different time intervals. PXRD was measured during 1, 4, and 24 hr after drying the sample in the fume hood for 4 hr. The amount of uptake was determined based on weight and TGA to be ~11%. Selectivity values were determined from the ratio of each isomer peaks using NMR and GC following literature protocols.13     3  Xylene Selectivity Studies in Liquid To study the xylene vapor kinetics on AZO-Cages, samples of 10 mg were added to 1 ml of xylene mixture (1:1:1) for different time intervals. PXRD was measured during 1, 4, and 24 hr after drying the sample in the fume hood for 24 hr. Selectivity values were determined from the ratio of each isomer peaks using NMR and GC following literature protocols.13 Synthesis of AZO-Cage    (E)-(Diazene-1,2-diylbis(4,1-phenylene)) dimethanol[7] (0.5 g, 2.1mmol) was dissolved in 50 ml dry chloroform and the suspension was cooled in an ice bath and Dess-Martin periodinane (2 g, 4.7 mmol) was added. The ice bath was removed and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 hr. The reaction mixture was extracted with an aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate and water (2 X 50 ml) and the organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated and the crude mixture was purified by column chromatography using chloroform as an eluent. An orange solid was obtained after evaporating the organic solvent (0.4 g, 81 %). The NMR matches the reported literature.[8]     NNCHOCHODMP,CHCl324h, RT   81%NNHOOH 4   Figure S1. Synthetic scheme for AZO-Cage.   (E)-4,4'-(Diazene-1,2-diyl)dibenzaldehyde (0.36 g, 1.5 mmol) was dissolved in 150 ml  CHCl3/EtOH (1:9). To the suspension, TREN (0.15 g, 1 mmol) in 5 ml EtOH was added dropwise during 30 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture stirred for 24 hr at the same temperature. An orange precipitate was formed after 24 hr which was filtered and washed with dry diethyl ether. The solid was dried at room temperature under vacuum for 5 hr.  This solid was purified by vapor diffusion crystallization, in which, 0.50 g was dissolved in chloroform in a small vial and was incubated in a bigger vial containing Hexane. The two vials were closed and the crystals were found after one day. The crystals were filtered and dried to have 73% (0.36 mmol, 0.32 g) yield. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): 8.30 (s, 1H), 7.45 (d, J= 9.8 Hz, 2H), 7.38 (d, J= 9.8 Hz, 2H), 3.86 (brs, 2H), 2.87 (brs, 2H).  13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3):161.5, 153.1, 138.1, 128.6, 122.9, 57.9, 52.5.
