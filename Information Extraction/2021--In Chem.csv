"2.3. Preparation of PdNPs ?Cage Complexes. Phos-cage (200mg, 0. 213 mmol) and K2PdCl4(66 mg, 0.202 mmol) were added inMeOH, tetrahydrofuran (THF), or pyridine (Py) (136 mL).

"The combined organic extract was washed with H2O (100 mL) threetimes, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and concentrated to yieldPdNPs as a muddy-brown powder (187 mg, 4.91 wt% Pd content),gray powder (183 mg, 3.15 wt% Pd content), and dark-brown powder(186 mg, 2.24 wt% Pd content), respectively, for PdNPs@cage ?MeOH, PdNPs ?cage?THF, and PdNPs ?cage?Py. The Pd contentwas determined by ICP analysis.2.4. General Procedure for the Reduction of p-NitrophenolCatalyzed by PdNPs ?Cage Complex. To a round-bottom ?askwere added an aqueous solution of p-nitrophenol (5 °¡10?3M, 5.0mL) and NaBH4(190 mg, 5.0 mmol). After stirring for °´5 min, asolution of PdNPs ?cage in EtOH was introduced, and the reactionprogress was monitored with the UV ?vis spectroscopy. The initialbright yellow mixture gradually turned to colorless as the reactionprogressed.",comprehensive synthesis
"2.5. General Procedure for the Suzuki ?Miyaura CouplingReaction Catalyzed by PdNPs ?Cage Complex. Aryl halide (0.50mmol), phenylboronic acid (0.55 mmol), K2CO3(0.75 mmol), andPdNPs ?cage (0.35 mol %) were added in toluene/H2O (1.5 mL, 9:1v/v) in a Schlenk tube. The reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h at 110°„C under nitrogen atmosphere. The crude product was extracted withethyl acetate and analyzed by1H NMR spectroscopy. After each run,the PdNPs ?cage was collected and washed with ethyl acetate andH2O several times and dried at 65 °„C under vacuum.",comprehensive synthesis
"Distinct color change from white gray to dark yellow wasobserved, indicating the successful formation of the Pd(II) ?cage?solvent complex. The Pd(II) ions were then reducedwith 20 equiv of NaBH 4(based on Pd), and the color turnedbrownish black immediately. The mixture was kept stirring for2h ,H2O was added into the obtained PdNPs ?cagecomplexes, and the mixture was extracted with CH 2Cl2.",comprehensive synthesis
"Again, the highest catalytic activity was observed for PdNPs@cage?MeOH, which contains small PdNPs encapsulated in thecavity. The catalytic activities of PdNPs ?cage complexes werefurther demonstrated with 0.35 mol % Pd loading for varioussubstrates, including aryl iodides (90 ?99% yield, entries 1 ?2),aryl bromides (90 ?99%, entries 3 ?4), and aryl chlorides (78 ?90%, entries 5 ?6). For all the substrates, PdNPs@cage ?MeOH consistently gave the highest yield, which was followedby PdNPs ?cage?THF and PdNPs ?cage?Py in a descendingorder. After being exposed to air for 1 and 7 days, all threePdNPs ?cage complexes achieved a conversion rate of >95%after reacting at 110 °„C for 2 h, demonstrating their excellentstabilities. In great contrast, the commercial Pd2(dba)3catalystcould give only 54% after being exposed to air for 12 h. Thestability of PdNPs ?cage complexes is likely due to thestabilization e ?ect of Phos-cage either as a coordinating ligandor a protective shell, which prevents the oxidation of metalactive centers.Recyclability is another key parameter for evaluatingcatalytic performance. The cycling stability was evaluated byperforming the coupling reaction between iodo-4-methylben-zene and phenylboronic acid multiple times. All three types ofPdNPs ?cage complexes exhibit high catalytic activity (>95%)even after ?ve consecutive runs ( Figure 5 b). However, therecycled Pd catalysts after the last run showed notably di ?erentdispersion. The PdNPs@cage ?MeOH still has the smallestdiameter of 0.89 °¿0.21 nm ( Figure S14a,b ), which is similarto the fresh PdNPs@cage ?MeOH, suggesting the excellentcon?nement and stabilization e ?ect of the cage. By contrast,Figure 5. (a) Comparison of catalytic activity of various Pd catalysts in reduction of p-nitrophenol.
