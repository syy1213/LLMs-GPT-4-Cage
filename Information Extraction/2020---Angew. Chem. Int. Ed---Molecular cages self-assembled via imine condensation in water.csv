Abstract: Self-assembly via imine condensation in aqueous media has been considered as a formidable task, due to the labile nature of imine in the presence of water. Here, by taking advantage of multivalence and ligand preorganization, a set of basket-shaped triscationic cage molecules are self-assembled in high yields as the predominant products in both water and organic solvent, by condensing a hexaformyl and bisamine. These cage products especially the chiral ones are rather stable or inert in aqueous solution, i.e., no remarkable decomposition was observed upon performing dilution, precipitation, or exposed to competitive amines or aldehydes. Such water-compatible nature allows the hosts to take advantage of hydrophobic effect to accommodate a variety of hydrophobic guests. The chiral cage S-23+ is capable of selectively binding and distinguishing one of the two enantiomers, opening up opportunities for applications such as chiral compound separation. Chiral narcissistic self-sorting and sergeants-and-soldiers effect are observed in the cage formation, when two amino precursors are involved in self-assembly.  Introduction One of the unique properties of host molecules, often in the form of macrocycles and cages, is their ability to use their intrinsic pockets to accommodate guests. Within the host cavities, the guests experience different chemical environments from the bulk solution. As a consequence, their properties are altered, enabling various tasks to be accomplished, such as separation of guests[1] with similar physical properties, stabilization of labile reaction intermediates[2] or energy demanding guest conformers,[3] as well as catalysis.[4] Synthesis of host molecules, especially those with complex three-dimensional architectures, often requires simultaneous formation of multiple covalent bonds. In order to avoid or suppress oligomeric and polymeric byproducts, dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC)[5] based on reversible reactions has been developed, including imine condensation.[6] One of the merits of using DCC is that, the reversible nature of dynamic bond allows the occurrence of error checking, as a consequence of which, a target molecule could be obtained in high or quantitative yield if it represents the most thermodynamically favored product.  However, one of the major disadvantages of using imine for self-assembly is that, imine is generally considered incompatible with water, a solvent leads to imine hydrolysis. The consequence is that, self-assembly via imine condensation is often or always performed in organic solvent in spite of a handful of exceptions.[7] These solvent molecules often occupy the cavities of hosts as competitive guests, jeopardizing their ability to accommodate other guests. In addition, the opportunities of using these molecules containing imine bonds in biological systems which choose water as the life medium are also ruined. Attempts to stabilize imine have been made successfully by either metal-coordination,[8] or replacing imine with more robust N-substituted derivatives such as hydrazone and oxime.[9] Using typical imine to self-assemble purely covalent host molecules in water is still a formidable task. Kim[6j] obtained a set of cubic cages, which were observed to be rather robust in organic¨Cwater media. Warmuth[7a,7b] and Cougnon[7c] independently self-assembled cryptophanes and catenanes in pure water via imine condensation. These successes rely on either hydrophobic guest templates or self-template in catenation. However, the shortcomings resulting from the labile nature of imine are still not addressed, limiting the practical applications of these systems. That is, these cryptophanes and catenanes are likely to undergo degradation upon removal of guest templates, switching the solvent, or changing the concentration. New approaches that lead to robust molecules in water still need to be exploited.  More recently, it has been observed[10] that multivalence could help to solidify the self-assembled molecular entities. That is, even though each of the dynamic bonds including imine is rather labile and apt to hydrolyze, the self-assembled molecules might become rather kinetically inert, when each of the building blocks is connected with each other via multiple linkages. Simultaneous cleavage of multiple bonds is obviously much more difficult than breaking a single dynamic bond. For example, a tetrahedron cage[10a] was self-assembled by condensing a trisamine and a trisformyl in CDCl3. The yield is close to quantitative on account of dynamic nature of imine. No ligand scrambling was observed when the cage was boiled with a competitive trisformyl ligands for no less than two days. We thus envision that by taking advantage of multivalence, cages could become robust in water without relying on guest templates. Such hypothesis was proven by a series of proof-of-concept experiments. That is, a set of basket-shaped cages were self-assembled by condensing a 1:3 mixture of hexaformyl compound and trans-diaminocyclohexane (CHDA) in both water and MeCN as the predominant product, in the yield of 60% and 92%, respectively.  When a more flexible bisamine, namely ethylenediamine (EDA), was used in self-assembly, cage self-assembly was less successful in water, i.e., substantial amount of polymeric byproducts were also observed.

Performing counterion exchange yielded a water-soluble cage, which was observed to be inert in water. In the case of the chiral cages containing more preorganized building blocks, such kinetic inertness is even more remarkable, i.e., no remarkable degradation via imine metathesis or hydrolysis was observed during counterion exchange, dilution, solvent switching, or exposed to competitive amines or aldehydes. The water-compatibility allows the cages to take advantage of hydrophobic effects to accommodate a variety of guests in water, including chiral ones. 1H NMR titration experiments demonstrated that one of the chiral cages is able to selectively recognize one of two enantiomers. Narcissistic self-sorting was observed when a racemic mixture of trans-CHDA was used in self-assembly, yielding a pair of cage enantiomers each of which contains only one type of CHDA enantiomers. When (S,S)-CHDA and EDA were combined together in self-assembly, a so-called sergeants-and-soldiers effect was observed. That is, cages containing one or more chiral diamino residues provide the same CD signal intensity as the counterpart containing only the chiral bisamino linkers. The commonly-accepted precept that self-assembly based on imine condensation yielding stable products wouldn¡¯t occur in water, is thus overturned to some extent.  Results and discussion A tricationic hexaaldehyde precursor 13+?3Br©¤ was synthesized (see the details in the Supporting Information (SI)), which bears three pyridinium and six formyl residues. The triscationic nature endows its water-solubility. 13+?3Br©¤ (6 mM) and (1S,2S)-(-)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane ((S,S)-CHDA) were combined (Figure 1) in a 1:3 ratio in D2O. After heating the solution of the mixture at 80 ¡ãC for no less than 8 h, 1H NMR spectrum was recorded (Figure S19), indicating that a basket S-23+?3Br©¤ was self-assembled as the predominant product. No other byproducts were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum. The resonances of the relatively acidic protons£¬ namely those in the methylene (marked with a red star in Figure 1) and pyridinium units (marked with a black star in Figure 1) disappeared due to deuteration. The yield of S-23+?3Br©¤ was determined to be around 60%, by using an internal standard in the corresponding 1H NMR spectrum (see Figure S67). The self-assembly of S-23+?3PF6©¤ was also successful in organic solvent, i.e., combining 13+?3PF6©¤ (6 mM) and (S,S)-CHDA (18 mM) in CD3CN produced S-23+?3PF6©¤ in almost quantitative yield. Water-soluble solid-state samples of the cage, namely S-23+?3NO3©¤, were isolated in 92% yield, by performing counterion exchange to the MeCN solution of S-23+?3PF6©¤ (see the SI for the counterion exchange procedure). The structures of S-23+?3PF6©¤ and S-23+?3NO3©¤ were fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy (Figures S5¨CS10) and mass spectrometry (Figures S11 and S12). 1H NMR spectrum of S-23+?3NO3©¤ recorded in D2O is pseudo identical as that of S-23+?3Br©¤ self-assembled directly in D2O, except that in the former case, the resonances of the relatively acidic protons were observed. The resonances of the methylene (marked with a red star in Figure 1) and imine protons (marked with a blue star) both split into two peaks, indicating the chirality of the cage framework of S-23+ (Figure S5). The chirality of S-23+ was also convinced by recording circular dichroism (CD) spectrum (Figure 2, red trace). When (1R,2R)-(-)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane ((R,R)-CHDA) was used, the enantiomer of S-23+, namely R-23+ was self-assembled (Figure 1, left), as inferred by its mirror-like CD spectrum (Figure 2, blue trace) as that of S-23+.

When a racemic mixture of the two amines are used, a racemic mixture of R-23+¡¤3Br©¤ and S-23+¡¤3Br©¤ are produced.",this paper's author
