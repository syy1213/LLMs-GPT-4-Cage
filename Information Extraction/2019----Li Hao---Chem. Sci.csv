"Guest recognition enhanced by lateralinteractions ?Tianyu Jiao,abKang Cai,bZhichang Liu,cGuangcheng Wu,aLibo Shen,aChuyang Cheng,bYuanning Feng,bCharlotte L. Stern,bJ. Fraser Stoddart *bdeand Hao Li *aA hexacationic triangular covalent organic cage, AzaEx2Cage6+, has been synthesized by means ofa tetrabutylammonium iodide-catalyzed S N2 reaction. The prismatic cage is composed of two triangular2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine ( TPT) platforms bridged face-to-face by three 4,40-bipyridinium ( BIPY2+)spacers. The rigidity of these building blocks leads to a shape-persistent cage cavity with an inter-platformdistance of approximately 11.0 ?A. This distance allows the cage to accommodate two aromatic guests,each of which is able to undergo p每pinteractions with one of the two TPT platform simultaneously, in anA每D每D每A manner. In the previously reported prism-shaped cage, the spacers (pillars) are often consideredpassive or non-interactive. In the current system, the three BIPY2+spacers are observed to play animportant role in guest recognition. Firstly, the BIPY2+spacers are able to interact with the carbonyl groupin a pyrene-1-carbaldehyde ( PCA) guest, by introducing lateral dipole 每cation or dipole 每dipole interactions.",this paper's author
