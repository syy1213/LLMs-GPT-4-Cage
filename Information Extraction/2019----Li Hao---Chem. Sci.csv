"Guest recognition enhanced by lateralinteractions ?Tianyu Jiao,abKang Cai,bZhichang Liu,cGuangcheng Wu,aLibo Shen,aChuyang Cheng,bYuanning Feng,bCharlotte L. Stern,bJ. Fraser Stoddart *bdeand Hao Li *aA hexacationic triangular covalent organic cage, AzaEx2Cage6+, has been synthesized by means ofa tetrabutylammonium iodide-catalyzed S N2 reaction. The prismatic cage is composed of two triangular2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine ( TPT) platforms bridged face-to-face by three 4,40-bipyridinium ( BIPY2+)spacers. The rigidity of these building blocks leads to a shape-persistent cage cavity with an inter-platformdistance of approximately 11.0 ?A. This distance allows the cage to accommodate two aromatic guests,each of which is able to undergo p¨Cpinteractions with one of the two TPT platform simultaneously, in anA¨CD¨CD¨CA manner. In the previously reported prism-shaped cage, the spacers (pillars) are often consideredpassive or non-interactive. In the current system, the three BIPY2+spacers are observed to play animportant role in guest recognition. Firstly, the BIPY2+spacers are able to interact with the carbonyl groupin a pyrene-1-carbaldehyde ( PCA) guest, by introducing lateral dipole ¨Ccation or dipole ¨Cdipole interactions.",this paper's author
