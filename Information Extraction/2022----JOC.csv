"For Cage-2 and Cage-3, the solvent systems of acetonitrile/CH 2Cl2 and 2-cyanopyridine are adopted. For Cage-3, diffusion of acetonitrile to the pyridine solution also can obtain crystals. In addition, the crystal of reference compound 5 (triphenylbenzene) is gained by recrystallization in 1,4-dioxane. The crystal structures are performed in an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, X-Pert, PANalytic, Netherlands) with Cu K¦Á radiation (40 kV, 30 mA). CCDC 2107131-2107135 contain the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.

"¡öRESULTS AND DISCUSSION1,8-Anthracenediamine ( 4) containing two amine groups waschosen as one of the reactants. 1,3,5-Tris( p-formylphenyl)-benzene ( 1) containing three aldehyde groups was ?rst chosenas the other precursor. The Schi ?base condensation has beenwidely used for the construction of MIMs due to its reversiblebond formation and self-healing behavior.28In this work, the[2 + 3] Schi ?base condensation is supposed to lead to theformation of a cage structure. To our surprise, the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of- ?ight mass spec-trometry (MALDI-TOF MS) revealed that the molecularweight of the obtained compound ( Cage-1 ) was 2596, which istwice the molecular weight of a monomeric molecular cage(1298). This observation suggested the formation of dualinterlocked cages. Subsequently, two control experiments weredone ( Figure 1 ). The central building units changed fromtriphenylbenzene ( 1) to benzene ( 2) and triphenylamine ( 3).",topology
