"Reaction of a spiropyran-functionalized dialdehyde 4with a?exible triamine tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (tren) easily yieldeddiscrete organic cage PC2 in 62% yield. The aldehyde buildingblock 4was synthesized by palladium-catalyzed Suzuki ?Miyaura cross-coupling reaction between bromo-spiropyran 3and diformylphenylboronic ester 2(Scheme 1 ). The imine-based cage compound PC1 was isolated as a yellow solid bytreating compound 4with the triamine ¡°tren ¡±in 3:2stoichiometric ratio in chloroform at room temperature for48 h. The cage PC1 was converted into more stable amine cagePC2 by sodium borohydride reduction of the dynamic iminebonds. The as-synthesized PC2 was characterized by multi-nuclear NMR (1H,13C),1H?1H COSY, FT-IR, and ESI-MSanalyses. In the ESI-MS spectrum ( Figure S23 ), the peak at m/z= 1425.8788 corresponding to [M + H]+speciesunequivocally advocates for the formation of the [3 + 2] self-assembled cage. Several e ?orts to crystallize this cage have sofar been unsuccessful.Photochromism and Thermochromism in the Solu-tion State. Compounds containing spiropyran moieties arewell-known for their photochromic and thermochromicbehavior. Therefore, organic cage PC2 decorated withspiropyran in its aromatic backbone shows SP ?MC isomer-ization which can be triggered by UV light and heat.",topology
