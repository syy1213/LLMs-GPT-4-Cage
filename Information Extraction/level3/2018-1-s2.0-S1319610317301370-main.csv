"Interestingly, we found cage molecules 2eself-assemble in adistinctive way in the solid state ( Fig. 5 a). Hydrogen bonddirected comb-like 2eassembly interlocks with another oneviap-pstacking to form ladder-like structure. The nano lad-ders further pile up to form 3D honey-comb layer, which isaround 6.6 A ?thick. In the layer, four 2emolecules interactwith each other to form a quasi-square pore, the size of thepore is 21.0 A ?* 21.0 A ?* 6.6 A ?. Due to the honey-comb layersstaggered on each other, no channel structure can be observedin the crystal of 2e, meanwhile, the nano pore is occupied bythe solvent molecules co-crystallized. That coincides with theBET test result, which shows a surface area only less than10 m2/g for 2ecrystal.",surface area

These cage-like compounds are tol-erante with different reaction conditions and can be derived with other functional groups in highyields. The X-ray crystal structures show these compounds have slightly distorted D 3hsymmetricstructures. Due to the unique molecular topological structure, bicyclocalix[2]arene[2]triazine mole-cules form unique layered comb networks when hydrogen bond groups exist (such as CO2H, B(OH) 2), which represent a new kind of building block unit for supramolecular architectures.",this paper's author
