"Department of Inorganic and Physical Chemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560012, India*SSupporting InformationABSTRACT: A discrete nanoscopic organic cage ( OC1R) hasbeen synthesized from a phenothiazine based trialdehydetreating with chiral 1,2-cyclohexanediamine building block viadynamic imine bond formation followed by reductiveamination. The cage compound has been characterized byseveral spectroscopic methods, which advocate that OC1Rhastrigonal prismatic shape formed via [2 + 3] self-assembledimine condensation followed by imine reduction. This newlydesigned cage has aromatic walls and porous interiordecorated with two cyclic thioether and three vicinal diaminemoieties suitable for binding gold ions to engineer thecontrolled nucleation and stabilization of ultra ?ne goldnanoparticles (AuNPs). The functionalized con ?ned pocketof the cage has been used for the controlled synthesis ofAuNPs with narrow size distribution via encapsulation of Au(III) ions. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometric (ICP-MS) analysis revealed that the composite Au@OC1Rhas very high ( ¡«68 wt %) gold loading. In distinction, reduction of goldsalts in absence of the cage yielded structureless agglomerates. The ?ne-dispersed cage anchored AuNPs ( Au@OC1R) havebeen ?nally used as potential heterogeneous photocatalyst for very facile and selective conversion of nitroarenes to respectiveazo compounds at ambient temperature in just 2 h reaction time. Exceptional chemical stability and reusability without anyagglomeration of AuNPs even after several cycles of use are the potential features of this material. The composite Au@OC1Rrepresents the ?rst example of organic cage supported gold nanoparticles as photocatalyst.",affiliation

"Molecular trigonal-prismatic cage OC1Rwas synthesized(¡«83% yield) via the reaction of phenothiazine basedtrialdehyde P3with a chiral diamine 4[(S,S)-1, 2-cyclo-hexanediamine] ( Scheme 1 ). The trialdehyde building blockP3was synthesized by a multistep synthetic procedure startingfrom phenothiazine ( Scheme S1 ). By treating trialdehyde P3with diamine 4in 2:3 stoichiometric ratio in chloroform atroom temperature for 48 h yielded imine based organic cageOC1 which was isolated as a yellow powder. Molecular cagewith [2 + 3] assembly of the aldehyde and amine isenthalpically favored owing to the least angle strain; andentropically favored as it comprises of minimum number ofbuilding blocks compared to all the possible 3D architectur-es.",topology
"11bImine bonds are sensitive to water and strong acids/bases. Hence, the imine cage ( OC1 ) was converted to stableamine cage OC1Rby treating with sodium borohydride whichreduced the imine bonds. As synthesized OC1Rwas wellcharacterized by multinuclear NMR (1H,13C),1H?1H COSY,1H NOESY,1H DOSY, FT-IR and ESI-MS analyses ( FiguresS18?S23). The formation of [2 + 3] assembled molecular cagewas unambiguously established by the peak at m/z=1269.6366 corresponding to [M + H]+in ESI-MS spectrum(Figure S21 ).",topology
