"Experimental SectionCompound 2: A mixture of benzene-1,3-diamine (3.24 g, 30 mmol)andp-toluenesulfonyl chloride (TsCl; 12.58 g, 66 mmol) in pyridine(25 mL) was heated with constant stirring at 120 ∼C for 2 h. Afterthe mixture cooled to room temperature, hydrochloric acid (0.1 n)was added to precipitate the product. The solid product was col-lected by filtration, washed thoroughly with water, and dried. Fur-ther purification by silica gel column chromatography with a mix-ture of petroleum ether and acetone (4:1) as the mobile phase gavepure 2(12.12 g, 97%) as a white solid.

"General Procedure for the Synthesis of 3: To a solution of 2(11.24 g,27 mmol) in a mixture of acetone (200 mL) and water (100 mL)was added NaOH (4.32 g, 108 mmol) with constant stirring atroom temperature. The temperature of the resulting mixture wasgradually increased to 80 ∼C, and alkyl bromide (162 mmol) wasthen added dropwise. After stirring at 80 ∼C for another 10 h, thereaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and extractedwith ethyl acetate (3 /H11003150 mL). The combined organic layer wasdried with anhydrous MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated. The resi-due was purified by silica gel (100每200) column chromatographywith a mixture of petroleum ether and chloroform (7:1) as the mo-bile phase to afford pure 3as a white solid.",comprehensive synthesis
