"By employing the approach of employing OMCs as foundationalunits to assemble advanced OMC-based polymers, a strategy is beingpursued to develop OMC-based OMC advanced superstructures.Developing a new OMC-based OMC is much more dif ?cult thandeveloping current OMCs as the complexity enhancement in super-structures. Especially, efforts to construct the intricate superstructuresdisplaying self-similarity across different scales in their arrangementfor enhancing and expanding their functional properties pose an evengreater challenge, requiring meticulous engineering of the constituentbuilding blocks37,38.

And,the following opposite rotational directions, two distinct chiral enan-tiomers, the racemic 2 P-CHO-TMC and 2 M-CHO-TMC are formed,exhibiting mirror-symmetric structures (Fig. 2). By computationalanalysis, the racemic 2 P-CHO-TMC and 2 M-CHO-TMCshowed the sametotal energy of ?4395.2800 Ha (Supplementary Fig. 36). In theassembly of the crystal lattice, these enantiomers coexist in equalproportions, resulting in an intertwined network structure (Supple-mentary Fig. 31). It is essential to highlight that separating theseenantiomers proves impractical, primarily due to the partial freedomof rotation and vibration exhibited by the phenyl rings within themolecular cage in solution. This ?exibility facilitates their inter-conversion, a process that lacks any discernible signals in circulardichroism (CD) spectra. (Supplementary Fig. 40). As demonstrated byZheng ＊sg r o u p55who successfully achieved the separation of enantio-mers with differing rotational directions of the phenyl rings byimplementing strategies that rest rict and impede the rotation of thephenyl rings. From a structural perspective, the O-bridged [2 + 3]molecular cage TMC (3D) and its scaffold TPB (2D) indeed share asimilar tri-bladed propeller-shaped helical structure in differentdimensions. Therefore, by incorporating 4-hydroxybenzene into themolecular cage CHO-TMC by the same C 每O每C bonds (SupplementaryFig. 32), it becomes possible to utilize this modi ?ed cage as a buildingblock for constructing higher-level [2[2 + 3] + 3] molecular cagesthrough a cage-to-cage strategy, where two instances of the modi ?edcage are assembled together to form a larger and more complexmolecular cage. The resulting structure would exhibit self-similarity,meaning that it retains the same overall pattern or structure at dif-ferent scales or levels of magni ?cation.",topology
"Synthesis of higher-level molecular cage 4 P-HTMC and 4 M-HTMC and their structure characterizationsFor the synthesis of [2[2 + 3] + 3] higher-level molecular cage, thebuilding block racemic CHO-TMC was reacted respectively with ( R,R)-or (S,S)-diaminocyclohexane (CHDA) in dichloromethane with cata-lysis amount of tri ?uoroacetic acid (TFA) at room temperaturethrough DCC (Fig. 1and Supplementary Figs. 2, 3, and 6 每9). Atten-tionally, regardless of the duration of the reaction or the temperatureat which it is conducted, the reaction of molecular cage CHO-TMCremains incomplete until an excess amount of CHDA is added. Afterthe CHO-TMC was consumed by the excess CHDA, the enantiopurehigher-level molecular cages 4 P-HTMC and 4 M-HTMC were obtainedwith yields of 94% and 91% by participating with MeOH. The obtainedcages 4 P-HTMC and 4 M-HTMC were characterized unambiguously byMALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, NMR, and SC-XRD. The results ofMALDI-TOF mass spectrometry showed that the 4 P-HTMC and 4 M-HTMC calcd for C174H120N24O18[M + H]+: 2835.96, found: 2835.93(Supplementary Fig. 28 and 29). Compared with the building blocksCHO-TMC, the increased steric hindrance in cages 4 P-HTMC and 4 M-HTMC promotes stronger 羽-羽stacking between the aromatic rings,resulting in a higher electron density in the stacked system. As a con-sequence, the proton signals experience an up-shift in their chemicalshifts. Additionally, the proton signals ( d, e, f ) of TPB units in buildingblock CHO-TMC are split into two sets of proton signals ( d, e, f andd＊,e＊,f＊)i nc a g e s4 P-HTMC and 4 M-HTMC.

The TPB units located on the inner side exhibit astrong shielding effect and, therefore, lead to a further up-shift of 0.38ppm (Fig. 3a). To con ?rm the fascinating phenomenon of intramole-cular self-shielding effect29, the 2D NMR spectra, such as1H,1H-COSY,1H,1H-NOESY,1H,13C-HSQC and1H,13C-HMBC NMR (SupplementaryFigs. 14 每21), can provide valuable information about the connectivityand spatial relationships within the molecules, which can help verifythe presence of the shielding effect and provide further evidencesupporting the observed up-shift and splitting of the proton signals.",topology
"In summary, a pair of enantiopure higher-level molecular cages4P-HTMC and 4 M-HTMC were synthesized by utilizing the racemicTPB-based [2 + 3] O-bridged oxacalixarene molecular cage (TMC) as3D tri-bladed propeller shaped building blocks through DCC. TheX-ray single crystal analysis showed that they exhibit elegant 3D tri-bladed propeller-shaped self-similar superstructures that resem-bled building blocks CHO-TMC and TPBs across the double andtriple-scaled expansion, respectively. The intrinsic cavity (3.9 ?) ofbuilding blocks was well preserved, and the new cavity (9.8 ?) wasintroduced as the cage-based OMCs 4 P-HTMC and 4 M-HTMCformed. The unique structural transformation leads to the creationof hetero-pores within a single molecular cage and intramolecularself-shielding effect, a feat that is challenging to achieve in currentOMCs. It is indeed intriguing that the assembly of 4 P-HTMC and 4 M-HTMC demonstrates exclusive narcissistic self-sorting and chiralinter-transformation, a phenomenon driven by steric hindrance andintricate chiral induction and ?xation.
