Generality ofthe approach was furtherexpanded bythe synthesis ofamacrocyle (M2) containing fouramide bonds viathe formation ofimine-based macrocycle (M1)followed bypost-synthesis oxidation (Scheme 2).Crystal struc-ture ofthe macrocycle (M2) revealed H-bonding interactionsbetween amide bonds and DMSO leading torapid aggregatesformation that limits itsuse inanion binding. Toour delight,the amide-based cage (C2) was intact insolution without anyaggregate formation because ofitsintrinsic 3D structure. ThecageC2was chemically and thermally stable and itsconfinedpocket containing sixamide bonds showed high selectivity forfluoride anion with abinding stoichiometry of1:2.Incompar-ison with chloride,C2exhibited ~3?103-fold stronger bindingaffinity forfluoride and itremained silent towards other halides,phosphate, and oxyanions.",affiliation

"Post-Synthesis Conversion ofanUnstableImineCagetoaStableCagewithAmideMoietiesTowardsSelectiveReceptorforFluoridePallab Bhandari[a]and Partha Sarathi Mukherjee*[a]Abstract: Synthesis ofrobust covalent macrocycles/cages viamultiple amide-bond forming reaction ishighly challengingand generally itneeds multistep reactions. One-pot reactionofappropriate di-/tri-acyl chloride with adiamine generallyresults polymers oroligomers instead ofdiscrete architec-tures. Toovercome this limitation, astrategy isreported hereusing dynamic imine chemistry for facile construction ofimine-based macrocycle and cage upon treatment ofadiamine with di-and tri-aldehydes respectively, followed bypost-synthesis one-step conversion ofimine bonds toamidestoform the desired robust macrocycle and cage containingmultiple amide bonds. While the macrocycle was found toform aggregates inDMSO, the cage was intact without anyaggregation. Sixamide groups inthe confined pocket ofthecage made itan ideal receptor for selective binding offluoride with very high selectivity (~3?103fold) over chloride,and itwas silent towards other halides, phosphate, and otheroxyanions.",this paper's author
