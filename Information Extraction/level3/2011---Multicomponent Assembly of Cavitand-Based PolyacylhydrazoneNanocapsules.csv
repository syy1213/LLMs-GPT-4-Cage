"[14a,b,15]For thesereasons, dynamic covalent chemistry has received tremen-dous attention in the development of novel responsive mate-rials,[14d,16]delivery devices,[17]and molecular libraries fordrug discovery,[18]as well as in the target-oriented synthesisof topologically complex molecules,[15,19]such as knots,[20]catenanes,[19b,21]rotaxanes,[22]or polycyclic receptors.[16i,23]Recently, we developed a rational design concept for theassembly of polycavitand nanocapsules using imine chemis-try (Scheme 1).[24¨C26]For example, condensation of tetra-formyl cavitand 1with two equivalents of a kinked, 120 8di-amine unit ( 5a,b) or a rigid, linear, 180 8diamine unit ( 6a)yields octaimine hemicarcerands ( 2a,b) or a hexadecaiminetetrahedral nanocapsule ( 3a) in close to quantitativeyield.[24b,d,e,27]On the other hand, a cavitand-hexamer ( 4a)forms upon reaction of six cavitands 1with eight planar,trigonal triamines ( 7a).[24a]The outcome of these assemblyprocesses relies on the rigidity of the building blocks, theirgeometric features, and the imine bonds as linear connec-tors, whereby the preferred condensation products becomestrongly favored over other possible polycyclic or acyclicoligomers. In other words, each nanocapsule is prepro-grammed into the specific combination of reactants. A dis-advantage of imine bonds is their relatively small stabilityAbstract: The thermodynamically con-trolled syntheses of different di-, tetra-,and hexacavitand polyacylhydrazonenanocapsules are reported. [2+4]-,[4+8]-, and [6 +12]-nanocapsules as-semble upon reacting a tetraformylcavitand with two equivalents of iso-phthalic dihydrazide, or terephthalic di-hydrazide in the presence of trifluoro-acetic acid, whereby the buildingblocks are linked together through 8,16, or 24 newly formed acylhydrazonebonds. Futhermore, the reaction of thetetraformylcavitands with differenttrigonal planar trihydrazides, simulta-neously leads to the formation of [2+4]- and [6 +8]-nanocapsules in varyingratios that depend on the cavitand totrihydrazide ratio and the nature of thecavitand and trihydrazide buildingblocks. The product ratios are rational-ized with the different conformationalstrain of the acylhydrazone linkages inthese nanocapsules. Diffusion NMR ex-periments with the hexacavitand polya-cylhydrazone nanocapsules yield solvo-dynamic radii that range from 1.6 to2.5 nm, consistent with estimates fromforce field calculations, and support,that these capsules have solvent filled,spherical interiors, the sizes of whichapproaches those of smaller proteins.",topology

Under otherwise identical condi-tions, tetrabromocavitand 17gave only small amounts ofcoupling products.Reaction of cavitands 1 and 8 with isophthalic dihydrazide5c: The reaction of 1with slightly more than stoichiometricamounts of isophthalic dihydrazide 5c(2.7 equiv)[38]inDMSO/chloroform containing two equivalents of trifluor-acetic acid (TFA) reached equilibrium after about two days.This mixture contained approximately 30% hemicarcerand2ctogether with excess 5cas judged from the1H NMRspectrum of the mixture (Figure 2A) and at least two othercondensation products that have equal or lower molecularweight according to gel permeation chromatography (GPC).Upon further standing at room temperature, 2ccrystallizedand could be isolated by filtration in 88% yield.

"Reaction of cavitands 1 and 8 with terephthalic dihydrazide6b: Based on the outcome of reactions between 1with rigid,linear diamines such as 6aor benzidine, which gave quanti-tatively tetrahedral [4+8]-condensation products ( 3),[24b]asimilar nanocapsule is expected for the condensation of 1with two equivalents of the linear dihydrazide buildingblock 6b. Indeed, the1H NMR spectrum of this reactionmixture showed that tetrahedral 3bis the main condensa-tion product ( >95%) and partially crystallized from the re-action mixture in 36% yield (Figure 6A,B).

"In contrast to 3b, for which evidence of formation of a re-lated octahedral hexacavitand capsule could not be obtainedin the1H NMR spectrum and MALDI TOF of the reactionmixture, 10band19must have comparable thermodynamicstabilities in solution. In earlier studies, we observed a simi-lar octahedral [6 +12]-capsule 24in the condensation of 1with two equivalents of ethylene-1,2-diamine in CHCl3,which formed in 82% yield, together with small amounts(/C255%) of the tetrahedral [4 +8]-capsule 3c(Schemes 1 and3). In THF, only 3cwas observed (35% yield). Our ration-ale for the formation of these nanocapsules, rather than thecorresponding hemicarcerand 2d([2+4]-condensation cap-sule), was: 1) the lower conformational energy of the 1,2-di-azaethylene units in the larger capsules, in which they canadapt the anti conformation, as opposed to 2d, which re-quires gauche conformations, and 2) the different ability ofthe solvent (CHCl3versus THF) to solvate the lowestenergy linker conformations in 20and 3c. Increasing thepreference for the anticonformation as in ethylene-1,2-bi-s(4¡¯anilide) (H2N-C6H4-CH2CH2C6H4-NH2) or using a rigid,linear diamine, such as 6bor benzidine, gave quantitativelya tetrahedral [4 +8]-condensation capsule. Thus, cavitand 1inherently prefers to form tetrahedral nanocapsules withlinear diamine components. This preference is confirmedwith the exclusive formation of 3band has also been ob-served in cavitand-based metal-coordination capsules.",topology
"[11a]Itcan be rationalized with the geometry of the cavitand build-ing block, in which adjacent and opposing aryl¨Ccarbonylbonds form angles of 44 and 63.88, which are too small for astrain-free octahedron (60 and 90 8) with a rigid diaminolinker and better suited for a smaller capsule.[42]However,the formation of 19in the condensation of 8with 6b, sug-gests that with increasing flexibility the inherent preferencefor the [4 +8]-capsule vanishes and that larger [6 +12]-con-densation capsules become accessible.",topology
"Reaction of cavitands 1 and 8 trihydrazides 7b¨Ce : We alsoinvestigated the possibility to assemble hexacavitand nano-capsules 4and11through the acid-catalyzed reaction of sixequivalents of 1or8with eight equivalents of C3-symmetrictrihydrazides ( 7b¨Ce; Scheme 1).

The1H NMRspectra of 4band11care also consistent with their structure(Figure 7B and Supporting Information), but show strongsignal broadening especially for 4b, which we explain with aconformational heterogeneity resulting from different orien-tations of the 24 acylhydrazone fragments and with the for-mation of different diastereomeric hexacavitand products11c.

"Hemicarcerand formation may compete with hexacavi-tand nanocapsule formation since the angle between two re-acting hydrazide groups in 7a¨Ceis appropriate for a [2+4]-condensation. The propensity of the different trihydrazidesto yield hexacavitand capsules and/or hemicarcerands canbe rationalized with the linker strain in these capsules andwith the tendency to maximize the number of intramolecu-lar hydrazone linkages. We estimated the strain associatedwith improper acylhydrazone conformations in the hexacavi-tand nanocapsules and hemicarcerands from energy-mini-mized structures (AMBER*, CHCl3) by comparing the con-formational energy of each linker with that of its lowestenergy conformation. Results are summarized in Table 1.",topology
"Based on these strain estimates, formation of a hexacavi-tand capsule is favored for the reaction of 1with trihydra-zide 7b. Inserting a phenyl unit into the cavitand/C29s aryl /C0CHO bond increases linker strain in the [6 +8]-condensationcapsule and reduces strain in the [2 +4]-condensation capsu-le beyond that of the former capsule, such that 20becomesthe only identifiable product in the reaction of 8with 7b.",topology
"For the same reason, reaction of 8with 7d, which is an ex-tended version of 7b, does not yield the [6 +8]-condensationcapsule 11d. Our strain calculations predict similar linkerstrain in hexacavitand capsule 11e and the correspondinghemicarcerand 22. In this case, the observed product ratio isbest rationalized with the tendency of this cavitand¨Ctrihy-drazide system to maximize the amount of hexacavitandcapsule 11e, which has a higher ratio of intra-/intermolecu-lar hydrazone bonds than 23, and to minimize the amountFigure 7.
