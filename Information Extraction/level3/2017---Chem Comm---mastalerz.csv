"Since the first descriptions of porous organic cages by Cooper et al. and Atwood et al. in 2009,1,2 the field has rapidly developed.3, 4 Meanwhile, systems have been realized with specific Brunauer -Emmett -Teller (BET) surface areas > 2000 m2/g,5 with mesopores ,6, 7 or highly selective  sorption of gases such CO 2,8, 9 SF6,10 or various noble gases.11 In cont rast to three -dimensional porous network systems, the organic cages are usually solub le and can therefore be processed into thin -films used for sensoring12, 13  or embedded  into membranes14, 15  for enhancing the selective separation of gases. What distinguishes por ous organic cages from insoluble networks  most  is the recently reported possibility to use organic cages to realize even porous liquids.16 With a few exceptions ,17 most shape -persistent organic cages are meanwhile synthesized by applying dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC), such as by the formation of imines through  the condensation of amines and aldehydes or the formation of boronic esters by the condensation of boronic acids and diols.18 Because the reactions are reversible, the most thermodynamically st able compound s are  usually formed from rather simple building blocks  in excellent yields because the system s can self -correct.  The obvious synthetic advantage of the reversibility is accompanied with a drawback  from a materials perspective, because the final product usually lacks chemi cal stability. In this respect , boronic ester cages are much more  labile than imine cages . Indeed, if acid an d nucleophiles (such as water) are absent in combination, imine cages have been shown to be some what  stable.19 In the presence of acid and nucleophile the imine bonds are usually cleaved very  fast leading to a decomposition of the molecular cage into smaller units, at the same time losing  porosity . One exception  are pyrogallol -based cages , where the formed imine bond is tautomerizing to a more stable enamine bond.  These cages have been reported to be stable in acidic solution up to pH 1 and basic solution up to pH 14.20 The stability after chemical treatment has been investigated by IR and PXRD only and PXRD data after acid or base -treatment show ed besides the original peaks a number of additional peaks.  However, although the cages are solu ble in common organic solvents the post -treatment compounds have not further been analysed by NMR spectroscopy.",surface area
"The reversibility of imine bond formation can be st opped by simple reduction to the corresponding amine function  with complex hydrides . Unfortunately, the reduction leads to a more flexible cage and finally the loss of shape -persistency is responsible for the loss of porosity.21-23 There have been  a very few approaches to post -functionalize organic cages.23-26 However, to  the best of our knowledge, the only  example for a post -functionalized chemical stabilization of porous organic imine cages has been described by. Cooper et al. :23 A small [4+6] imine cage was reduced to the corresponding amine cage and the internal ortho diamine functions were subsequently ¡®tied¡¯ as aminals  with either one molecule of acetone or four molecules of formaldehyde .23 Whereas the acetone derived cage is decomposing already in solution, which was monitored by NMR, the formaldehyde derived a minal cage crystals were stable at room temperature in solutions with pH between 1.7 and 12.3  for at least 12 days . Whereas the aminal  cage tied with only one acetone was still too flexible to be shape -persistent, the one tied with four formaldehydes retained shape -persistency. This was reflected by apparent BET surface areas of 67 m2/g and 377 m2/g, respectively.",surface area
"The isotherm can best be described as a mixture of a type I and a type IV isotherm.30 The calculated specific surface area of cage 3 is with 105  m2/g (BET  model) substantially lower than for [2+3] -imine cage 1 (744 m2/g), but it is much larger than for the more flexible corresponding amine cage 2 (12 m2/g), which is in accordance to reported data of other, flexible amine cages.21-23 Figure 2 .

"A second sample was prepared by dissolving the carbamate cage 3 in hot DMSO  and dripping this solution into cold water to crush out the compound.  The precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with water and immersed first in acetone (7x) and finally in n -pentane (7x) before activating at 200 oC in vacuum (16 h). The nitrogen sorption isotherm was very similar to the first sample (BET SA = 113 m2/g), suggesting that the sample is rather a mixture of both polymorphs with a substantially higher content of the nonporous polymorph ¦Â.",surface area
"This sample was treated with acid (10 M HCl, 16 h at rt) and investigated again by gas sorption and SEM. The crystallite morphology did not change  after treatment with acid (nor by base, s ee Figure S38). The apparent BET SA measu red by N 2 at 77 K was  194 m2/g and a comparable amount of CO 2 (11.2 wt% at 1 bar and 273 K) was adsorbed;  once more showing that the treatment is not affecting the materials properties.",surface area

"By different crystallization conditions, two polymorphs have been found. Both polymorphs crystallized in the triclinic space  group P-1. Polymorph ¦Á from methanol/DMF  has the larger unit cell ( V = 9758 ?3, Figure 1a) with two molecules in the asymmetric uni t than polymorph ¦Â from DMSO/aceton e (V = 4204 ?3, Figure 1b), with only one molecule in the asymmetric unit.  The conformational arrangement of molecular units is in both polymorphs comparable. The distance of about 8.5 ? between the inner triptycene bridg ehead hydrogen atoms is substantially  larger than found in the crystal structure of the [2+3] -imine cage 1 (7.8 ?).27 In both polymorphs, t he cages are packi ng mainly via CH -¦Ð- and dispersion interactions (Figure 1b).",topology

According to the  TGA the compound was activated thermally (200 oC, 3 h), before measuring gas sorption. At 77 K the compound adsorbs 148 cm3/g nitrogen.",topology
"However, despite the apparently small  specific surface area of cage 3 measured by N 2 adsorption  at 77 K , the compound adsorbed relatively large amounts of CO 2 at 273 K and 1 bar (58 cm3/g; 11.5 wt%),  suggesting that the diffusion of gas molecules is kinetically hindered at 77 K, because of the win ded pore -system, some narrow ed sites and the found dead -ends. Another possibility that needs to be taken into account is a substantial transformation of polymorph ¦Á to polymorph ¦Â by the activation process, which need to be investigated in more detail. It is worth mentioning that for a flexible [2+3] imine cage, which we published before,27 a very similar behavi our was found. The amount of adsorbed CO 2 is comparable to other porous materials derived from cages of similar size s and much higher than e.g. for flexible amine cages  (see Table 1);21 but lower than e.g. for a cubic imine cage (18.2wt%).8 Furthermore , c) d)dead -enda) b)Page 3 of 4 ChemCommChemComm Accepted Manuscript Published on 07 July 2017.

"To summarize, we introduced a chemical post -stabilization of prior lab ile [2+3] imine cage 1 in a two -step approach by first reduction of the imine bonds to amine bonds, followed by a reaction with N,N¡¯ -carbonyldiimidazole to give the carbamate cage 3. The cage is stable in 1 M hydrochloric acid (pH = 0) , even when heated at 100 oC and also in concentrated hydrochloric acid (pH = -1) at room temperature , at least for 16 hours. The carbamate cage is also stable in 1 M aqueou s NaOH -solution (pH = 14). C age 3 is permanent porous and took up significant amoun ts of CO 2 (11.5 wt%) at 273 K and 1 bar. To the best of our knowledge, this is in respect to the broad pH range the most stable porous organic cage compound described  to date . The carbamate formation is not restricted to the here described [2+3] imine cage  1 or amine cage 2 and can be applied to all cages, derived from salicylaldehyde s and aromatic amine precursors.5, 8, 13, 33 -40  We would like to thank the DFG for financial support (project MA4061 -4/2 and SFB 1249), the China Scholarship  Coun cil (CSC) for a scholarship for X. -Y.
