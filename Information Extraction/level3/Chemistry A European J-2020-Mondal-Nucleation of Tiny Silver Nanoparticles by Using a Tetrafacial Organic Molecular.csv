Inthisregard, our group has recent lyreported severa lfunctionalizedorganic cages byusing dynamic imine chemistry .Such cagesshowe dpotentia lapplications[5]inexplosives sens ing and incatalys is.Although consid erable efforts inrecent times havebeen direct edtothesynthesis ofseveral organic cage com-pounds ofvarious sizesand shapes, examples oforganic mo-lecular barrel s[6]obtained byusing dynamic covalen tbonds arestillrare. The barrel structure has several benef itsowing toitsporou sconfined space.
