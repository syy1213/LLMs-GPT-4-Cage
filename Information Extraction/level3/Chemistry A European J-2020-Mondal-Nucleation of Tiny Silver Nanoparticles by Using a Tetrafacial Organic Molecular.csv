However ,analogous organic molecu larassem-blies arehardtoachieve byusing traditi onal multistep organicsynthe sis,which generally leads tolow yield ofthefinal prod-ucts. Ther efore, dynam iccovale ntchemistr y(DCC) hasbeen in-troduc edasanefficient altern ativeapproac htoharvest organ-iccage compounds[4]from simple buildin gblocks. Inthisregard, our group has recent lyreported severa lfunctionalizedorganic cages byusing dynamic imine chemistry .Such cagesshowe dpotentia lapplications[5]inexplosives sens ing and incatalys is.Although consid erable efforts inrecent times havebeen direct edtothesynthesis ofseveral organic cage com-pounds ofvarious sizesand shapes, examples oforganic mo-lecular barrel s[6]obtained byusing dynamic covalen tbonds arestillrare. The barrel structure has several benef itsowing toitsporou sconfined space. Furth ermo re,the two open faces ofthe barrel can beused asentry and exit windo wsforsub-strates andproducts ,respectivel y.The present article reportsanunusual example ofanorganic tetrafa cialmolecu larbarrel(OB4R)includi ngitsuse asapotential molec ular vessel forthesynth esisofsilver nanop articles (/C251.44 nm).[14]Magnetic, optoel ectron ic,and medicinal properties ofmetalnanop articles (MNPs) have been widel yused forvarious pur-poses.[7]Owingtotheir high surface area/volum eratio with anumber ofunsaturation sites, tiny MNPs areoften preferr edover the bulk metal precu rsors incatalysis.[8]Moreover ,MNPshave drawn special attention inphoto catalysis owing totheirlocalized surfac eplasmon resonan ce(LSPR) effect.[9]This effectmainly implies the collective resonanc ebetween conductionband electrons with incide ntlight, which mostlygenerat esholes and hot electr ons (h¨Ce) ontheMNP surface.[10]Thus, ul-trafin eMNPs promote photocatalytic reactio nsowing totheLSPR effect, which isthermodyna mically not feasible intheground state.[11]Inthis respect, silver nanop articles (AgNP s)areappeal ingowing totheir LSPR effectinthevisible light region(400¨C 800nm).[12]Moreov er,photocatalyt icroutes under visiblelight are often lesstoxic, involves less energy consu mption,and aremore eco-fri endly comp ared withconventiona lwet-chem icalmethods.
