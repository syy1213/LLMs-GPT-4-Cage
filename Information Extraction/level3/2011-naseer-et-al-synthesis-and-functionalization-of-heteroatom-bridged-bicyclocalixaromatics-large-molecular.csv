"As summarized in Table 1, when DIPEA was used as a base, thereaction in nitromethane, acetonitrile, acetone, and 1,4-dioxane atroom temperature produced either none or a low yield of product 3(entries 1 -4, Table 1). The use of THF as the reaction media gaveproduct 3in 21% yield (entry 5, Table 1). The reaction wasfacilitated in re ?uxing THF, and the chemical yield of 3wasimproved to 31% (entry 6, Table 1). Other bases such as Et3N,K2CO 3,o rC s 2CO 3instead of DIPEA in re ?uxing THF, however,had a detrimental e ?ect, forming product 3in a diminished yield(entries 7 -9, Table 1).

By means of a fragment couplingapproach, molecular triangular prisms of electron-rich andelectron-de ?cient aromatic interiors were prepared using1,3,5-tri( p-hydroxyphenyl)benzene and 2,4,6-tri( p-aminophe-nyl)triazine as base units and chlorotriazines as pillars. Aro-matic nucleophilic substitution reaction of chlorotriazinemoieties with functionalized amines led to triangular prismswith functionalizations on the peripheral edge positions, whilefunctionalized triangular prisms on the vertex nitrogen posi-tions were obtained using 2,4,6-tri[( p-allylamino)phenyl]-triazine derivative as a starting material. Symmetrical anddistorted molecular triangular prisms in the solid state were revealed by X-ray crystallography. As evidenced by NMR spectroscopicdata, however, all cage molecules synthesized most probably adopted highly symmetric triangular prism structures in solution phase.The functionalized shape-persistent triangular prism structures might ?nd applications in molecular recognition and in theconstruction of higher and more sophisticated molecular architectures in supramolecular chemistry.",this paper's author
