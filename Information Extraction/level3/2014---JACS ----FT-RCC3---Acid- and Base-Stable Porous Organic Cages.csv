S2	 ?Note on Nomenclature: Helicity, or axial chirality, is an intrinsic property of these molecular cages. All six bisimino vertices must be of the same enantiomer, and the vertex substituents must occupy exo-positions, in order to obtain a tetrahedral molecular structure. In this study, CC3 was prepared using the homochiral (1R,2R)-cyclohexanediamine to give the homochiral cage, CC3-R. All reactions reported proceed identically with the opposite enantiomer, CC3-S. Where the cage is referred to as CC3, for brevity, this refers to the homochiral cage, CC3-R, rather than the racemate (CC3-R,S). Reducing CC3 to RCC3 and the further modification to AT-RCC3 and FT-RCC3 does not change the chirality of the cage.   1. Experimental Details  1.1. Materials. 1,3,5-Triformylbenzene was purchased from Manchester Organics, UK. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. CC3 (Cage 3) was prepared as previously reported in its homochiral form, CC3-R.1  1.2 Synthesis of RCC3. The imine cage CC3-R (926 mg, 0.83 mmol) was dissolved in a CHCl3 / methanol mixture (1:1 v/v, 50 mL) by stirring. When this solution became clear, sodium borohydride (1.00 g, 26.5 mol) was added and the reaction was stirred for a further 12 hours at room temperature. Water (2 mL) was then added, and the reaction stirred for a further 12 hours. The solvent was then removed under vacuum. The resulting white solid was extracted with chloroform (2 °¡ 50 mL) and then the combined organic phase was washed by water (2 °¡ 100 mL). The CHCl3 phase was dried using anhydrous MgSO4 before being removed under vacuum. Amine cage 1 (crude yield = 900 mg, 95.1 %) was obtained as a white solid. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz) ¶ƒ 7.12 (s, 12H, -ArH), 3.81 (d, 12H, -ArCH2), 3.59 (d, 12H, -ArCH2), 2.18 (m, 12H, CH on cyclohexane), 0.95 - 1.98 (m, 48H, CH2 on cyclohexane) ppm; 13C NMR  (CDCl3, 100 MHz): ¶ƒ 141.2, 124.9, 61.2, 50.7, 32.0, 25.0 ppm.

Synthesis of AT-RCC3. The reduced amine cage RCC3 (50 mg, 0.044 mmol) was dissolved in 3 mL acetone in a 10 mL vial. The vial was sealed and left to stand. Single crystals of AT-RCC3 gradually appeared on the walls and the bottom of the vial after about 30 min. The crystals were collected after 12 h by filtration and washed by acetone (2 °¡ 100 mL). Yield: 39 mg, 75.4 %.

To this clear solution was added RCC3 (100 mg) dissolved in CH3OH (10 mL). A white precipitate appeared upon addition of RCC3. The reaction was stirred for a further 2 h at 70 °„C. The reaction was cooled to room temperature and the precipitate was collected by filtration. FT-RCC3 (52 mg, 70 %) was obtained after being washed with CH3OH (3 °¡ 10 mL) and dried under vacuum. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz) ¶ƒ 7.11 (s, 12H, -ArH), 3.99 (d, 12H, -ArCH2 ), 3.23 (s, 12 H, -NCH2N-), 3.19 (d, 12H, -ArCH2 ), 2.27 (d, 12H, CH on cyclohexane), 1.96 (d, 12H, CH2 on cyclohexane ), 1.80 (d, 12H, CH2 on cyclohexane ), 1.28 (m, 24H, CH2 on cyclohexane) ppm; 13C NMR  (CDCl3, 100 MHz): ¶ƒ 140.1, 123.6, 77.2, 68.8, 57.3, 29.4, 24.4 ppm.

Solution 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 400.13 MHz using a Bruker Avance 400 NMR spectrometer. 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 100.6 MHz.   1.5.2 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). IR spectra were collected on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer. Samples were analyzed as KBr disks for 16 scans with a resolution of 4 cm-1. Spectra were recorded in transmission mode.  1.5.3 Thermogravimetric Analysis. TGA analysis was carried out using a Q5000IR analyzer (TA instruments) with an automated vertical overhead thermobalance. The samples were heated at the rate of 5 °„C /min.   1.5.4 Powder X-ray Diffraction. Laboratory powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were collected in transmission mode on samples held on thin Mylar film in aluminum well plates on a Panalytical X°ØPert PRO MPD equipped with a high throughput screening (HTS) XYZ stage, X-ray focusing mirror, and PIXcel detector, using Ni-filtered Cu K¶¡ radiation. Data were measured over the range 5?50°„ in °´0.013°„ steps over 60 min.  1.5.5 Electron Microscopy. Imaging of the crystal morphology was achieved using a Hitachi S-4800 cold field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) operating in both scanning and transmission modes. Scanning-mode samples were prepared by depositing dry crystals on 15 mm Hitachi M4 aluminum stubs using an adhesive high-purity carbon tab before coating with a 2 nm layer of gold using an Emitech K550X automated sputter coater. Imaging was conducted at a working distance of 8 mm and a working voltage of 3 kV using a mix of upper and lower secondary electron detectors. Transmission-mode samples were prepared by dispersing the cage particles in a methanol suspension and depositing onto carbon-coated copper grids (300 mesh), imaging at 30 kV working voltage and 7 mm distance. 	 ? S4	 ?1.5.6 Gas Sorption Analysis. Gases of the following purities were used: hydrogen (99.9995% - BOC gases) and carbon dioxide (SCF grade ®C BOC gases). Surface areas and pore size distributions were measured by nitrogen adsorption and desorption at 77.3 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 volumetric adsorption analyzer. Samples were degassed at offline at 80 °„C for 15 h under vacuum (10-5 bar) before analysis, followed by degassing on the analysis port under vacuum, also at 80 °„C. Carbon dioxide isotherms were measured at 289K using a Micromeritics 2420 volumetric adsorption analyzer using the same degassing procedure.  1.5.7 Single Crystal X-ray Diffraction.  Single crystal X-ray data were measured on a Rigaku MicroMax-007 HF rotating anode diffractometer (Mo-K¶¡ radiation, ¶À = 0.71073 ?, Kappa 4-circle goniometer, Rigaku Saturn724+ detector). Or for formaldehyde tied reduced CC3 (FT-RCC3) at beamline I19, Diamond Light Source, Didcot, UK using silicon double crystal monochromated radiation (¶À = 0.6889 ?).2 Empirical absorption corrections using equivalent reflections were performed with the program SADABS.3 Structure were solved with SHELXD,4 or by direct methods using SHELXS,4 and reined by full-matrix least squares on F2 by SHELXL-97,4 interfaced through the programme OLEX2.5 Unless stated all non-H atoms were refined anisotropically and H atoms were fixed in geometrically estimated positions using the riding model. In the absence of heavy scatters Friedel pairs were merged.  1.6 Desolvation of RCC3. To obtain a large quantity of crystalline RCC3 for subsequent analysis, a solution of RCC3 dissolved in CHCl3 was allowed to slowly evaporate over two days. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) confirmed that this solvate material was the same phase as the single-crystal structure (Figure S1). Different desolvation methods for activation of the RCC3 solvate were investigated, including high/low temperature vacuum, N2 flow, solvent exchange, and supercritical CO2 drying. However, none of these activation conditions maintained the crystallinity of RCC3 upon desolvation, and we instead isolated an amorphous solid in all cases that showed no Bragg reflections in the PXRD pattern (Figure S1).",comprehensive synthesis
"Schi?-base chemistry is one of the most versatile methods forthe construction of organic macrocycles and cages.1Thereversibility of the imine bond-forming reaction gives a route tothermodynamically equilibrated products. This has been used toproduce crystalline porous organic solids, such as covalentorganic frameworks (COFs)2and porous molecular organiccages.3In particular, a series of porous, shape-persistent iminecages has been reported,4and surface areas as high as 3758 m2/ghave been attained,5thus rivaling extended frameworks such asmetal?organic frameworks (MOFs).6Porous molecular organicsolids show promise as adsorbents for radioisotope pollutants,7as molecular additives in organic ?organic mixed-matrixmembranes,8as shape-selective chromatography phases,9andas materials for molecular sensing.10However, the reversibility of imine chemistry, which permitsequilibrium products to form, can also cause problems ofchemical instability, thus limiting its wider application. Imines areprone to hydrolysis and can decompose upon exposure toatmospheric moisture, although there are some exceptions tothis.2,11Imines are even more prone to hydrolysis in acidic orbasic environments. A straightforward way to make an iminemore chemically stable is to reduce it to the correspondingamine. In addition to enhancing chemical stability, amine cagesare also readily functionalized12and can provide binding sites forguests such as CO 2.13However, while many amine cages andmacrocycles have been reported via imine reduction, no trulyshape-persistent porous amine cages have been discovered. Thisis because reduction to the amine introduces additional ?exibilityin the cage molecule, and this leads to loss of the internal cavity,or pore. We previously reported a [4+6] amine cage formed byreduction of the equivalent imine cage, CC1, but crystallizationattempts yielded only amorphous, nonporous solids for theamine derivative.",surface area

"Like CC3, desolvated AT-RCC3 packs in a window-to-window fashion (Figure 2a). Gas adsorption analysis fordesolvated AT-RCC3 (Figure 3a) showed that the materialadsorbs a very modest amount of N2(1.11 mmol/g) and H 2(1.29 mmol/g) at 77 K and 1 bar. The apparent BET surface areawas just 67 m2/g, as calculated from the N 2isotherm. This surfacearea and gas uptake are substantially lower than for isostructuralCC3.3aHowever, close to ambient temperature, a CO 2uptake of1.77 mmol/g was observed for AT-RCC3 ¨∫that is, 8 timeshigher than for RCC3 (Figure 3b). The ideal gas selectivity forCO 2/N2was calculated as 57 at 298 K and 1 bar. This is close tothe CO 2/N2selectivity of the [2+3] imine cages reported byZhang et al.,15but with a much higher absolute CO 2uptake (1.77mmol/g for AT-RCC3 vs 0.1?0.25 mmol/g for the Zhangcages). The lack of N2and H2adsorption at low temperature inAT-RCC3 is explained by its crystal structure. The solvent-accessible surface with a N2probe radius of 1.82 ?21showsformally disconnected voids (Figure 2b). This is because thedimethyl groups block two of the four windows on each AT-RCC3 cage. The interconnectivity of the pore structure for N2thus depends upon the spatial arrangement of these dimethyl-blocked windows with respect to one another.",surface area
"The FT-RCC3 material can be fully desolvated under dynamicvacuum for 12 h at 80 °„C. Unlike AT-RCC3 , there was noindication of any loss of crystallinity for FT-RCC3 after eitherdesolvation or after gas adsorption, a promising indicator ofincreased shape persistence (Figures S10 and S11). The porousnature of FT-RCC3 was next probed by N2,H2, and CO2adsorption. Nitrogen adsorption measurements at 77 K showed aType I isotherm (Figure 3a), with a total gas uptake of 11.2mmol/g at 1.0 bar and an apparent BET surface area of 377 m2/g.",surface area
"This is only slightly lower than the 409 m2/g measured for theparent imine cage, CC3.17However, both materials haveprecisely the same °∞molar °±BET surface area of 457 m2/mmolwhen their molecular weights are considered. FT-RCC3 adsorbs4.3 mmol/g of H 2at 77 K and 1.0 bar, and 1.42 mmol/g of CO 2at298 K and 1 bar. As can seen from the calculated solvent-accessible surface (Figure 3c), the pores in FT-RCC3 areinterconnected for a 1.42 ? H2probe. This interconnectivitypersists for a smaller 1.55 ? probe (equivalent to a N 2moleculeoriented end-on) but becomes formally disconnected for a N 2van der Waals radius probe of 1.82 ?. We assume that breathingmotions of the molecule allow for di ?usion of N 2through thepore structure, as observed for CC3.23A conformational search for FT-RCC3 found that the lowestenergy conformer was the observed shape-persistent structure,comprising a permanent void (Figure 2d). A partially foldedconformation (Figure S12) was also found to lie 22 kJ/molhigher in energy, as calculated with the OPLS-AA force ?eld.24DFT calculations (see SI for full details) con ?rmed that the openstructure was indeed the lowest energy molecular structure, withan energy gap of 14 kJ/mol. An overlay of the calculatedmolecular structure with the experimental structure (Figure 3d)shows excellent agreement, with RMSD = 0.079 ? (excludingH°Øs).",surface area
