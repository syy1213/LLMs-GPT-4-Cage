"Synthesis of  CC3:  CC3-R was prepared as previously reported in its homochiral form.[1] Dichloromethane (100 ml) was layered slowly onto solid triformylbenzene (TFB, 5 g, 30.86 mmol) without stirring at room temperature. Trifluoroacetic acid (1 mL) was adde d directly to this solution as a catalyst for the imine bond formation. Finally, a solution of ( R,R)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane (5 g, 44.64 mmol) in dichloromethane (100 mL) was added to this, again without mixing. The reaction was covered and left to stand. Over 5 days, al l of the SUPPORTING INFORMATION           2  solid triformylbenzene was used up and octahedral crystals of CC3 grew on the sides o f the glass reaction vessel. The crystalline product was removed by filtration and washed with 95 % ethanol / 5 % dichloromethane.",comprehensive synthesis
"A large -scale synthesis of CC3 has also been recently developed, a typical procedure is described as follows.  A batch reacto r was charged with 4,000 mL of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and pre -heated to 50 °„C. 1,3,5 -Triformylbenzene (400g, 2.46 mol) and solid ( R,R)-1,2-Diaminocyclohexane (431g, 3.77 mol) were added to the pre -heated solvent under continuous stirring. After stirring f or five minutes, trifluoroacetic acid (8 mL, 0.047 mol) was added to the reaction mixture. Once the addition of the acid was complete the reaction is slowly ramped up to 78  °„C and held for 17 hours with continuous stirring. After 17 hours the reactor is co oled to room temperature and the resulting off -white suspension is collected by vacuum filtration. This solid is then washed with further IPA and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °„C overnight to yield CC3 as a fine white powder.  Yield 623 g, 94.7%.",comprehensive synthesis
"Synthesis of RCC3 : RCC3 was prepared and purified as previously reported .[2] The imine cage CC3 -R (926 mg, 0.83 mmol) was dissolved in a CHCl 3 / methanol mixture (1:1 v/v, 50 mL) by stirring. When this solution became clear, sodium borohydride (1.00 g, 26.5 mol) was added and the reaction was stirred for a further 12 hours at room temperature. Water ( 2 mL) was then added, and the reaction stirred for a further 12 hours. The solvent was then removed under vacuum. The resulting white solid was extracted with chlor oform (2 °¡ 50 mL) and then the combined organic phase was washed by water (2 °¡ 100 mL). The CHCl 3 phase was dried using anhydrous MgSO 4 before being removed under vacuum. RCC3 (crude yield = 900 mg, 95.1 %) was obtained as a white solid. RCC3 was purified by using the reversible reaction with acetone. In a 250 mL flask, 1000 mg crude RCC3 was dis solved in acetone (100 mL). The solution was covered and left to stand. Crystals started appearing on the wall of the flask after 30 mins. The crystals (AT -RCC3) were collected after one day by filtration and were then dissolved in a CHCl 3 /CH 3OH mixture ( 1:1 v/v) by stirring. Several drops of distilled water were added to the solution and the mixture was stirred for another 12 h. After removal of the solvents, pure RCC3 (680 mg, 70.4 %)  was recovered.",comprehensive synthesis
"Synthesis of FT -RCC3. FT-RCC3 was prepared as previou sly reported.[2] Paraformaldehyde (52 mg, 20 eq.) dissolved in CH 3OH (10 mL) was stirred at 70 °„C. To this clear solution was added RCC3 (100 mg) dissolved in CH 3OH (10 mL). A white precipitate appeared upon addition of RCC3. The reaction was stirred for a  further 2 h at 70 °„C. The reaction was cooled to room temperature and the precipitate was collected by filtration. FT -RCC3 (52 mg, 70 %) was obtained after being washed with CH 3OH (3 °¡ 10 mL) and dried under vacuum.",comprehensive synthesis
"Thehighest SO2capture wasachieved with 6FT-RCC3,reaching amaximum uptake of13.68 mmol g/C01(Figure 2),thisuptake isonly behind thereported benchmark MOFs such asMOF-177,[36a]MIL-101(Cr) 4F(1 %),[21]orMFM-170[43c](25.7,18.4 and17.5mmol g/C01,respectively). Itisworth noting thattheBET surface area ofabovementioned three MOFs allexceeds 2000 m2g/C01,while for6FT-RCC3 is396m2g/C01.Acomparison ofSO2uptakes andtheBET surface area ofsomerepresentative MOF materials isprovided inFigure S3whichhighlights thehighly competitive SO2capture performance of6FT-RCC3 cage,considering itsmodest surface area. Inter -estingly ,6FT-RCC3 shows asignificant SO2capacity atlowSO2pressures :at0.1bar6FT-RCC3 captures 8.67mmol g/C01ofSO2.Thisuptake isslightly ,higher than the value of8.28mmol g/C01at1barand 298Kobserved forMFM-300-(In),[20b]aM OF material with asuperior surface area(approximately 1100 m2g/C01).When comparing theSO2up-take by6FT-RCC3 atlowpartial pressures (e.g.,0.01bar,0.15barand 0.5bar) theSO2capacities were 3.57molg/C01;9.48mmol g/C01and11.94 mmol g/C01which outperforms severalMOF materials such as:MFM-170 (/C256.5mmol g/C01at0.1bar),[43]SIFSIX-3-Ni (2.43 mmol g/C01at0.01bar),[44a]MOF-177 (0.3mmol g/C01at0.01bar,1.0mmol g/C01at0.1bar),[36a]MIL-125(T i)-NH2(3.0mmol g/C01at0.01bar,7.9mmol g/C01at0.1bar);[36a]aswell asvarious polymers/COF materials ,suchasCTF-CSU41 (6.7mmol g/C01at0.15bar)andCTF-CSU38 (4.4mmol g/C01ofat0.15bar);[45]ionic micro-porous polymer P(Ph-4MVIm-Br) (2.43 mmol g/C01at0.01barand4.14mmol g/C01at0.1bar);[44b]anditiscomparable toMOFSIFSIX-1-Cu (3.43 SO2mmol g/C01at0.01bar) (see Fig-ureS4).[44a]Thisremarkable uptake atlow SO2partialpressures indicates thepossibility ofusing solid 6FT-RCC3fortrace SO2capture .",surface area
"Additional  experiments  In order to evaluate the stability of 6FT -RCC3 cage in the presence of SO 2 and humidity, we carried out a qualitative experiment with a homemade syst em previously reported (see Fig. S 16).[6], [7] The system contains two principal parts: SO 2 gas generator (A) dropping funnel with H 2O. [1] connected to a Schlenk flask with Na 2SO 3(s) under stirring [2]; and the saturation chamber (B), constructed from a round flask with distilled water [3], connected to a sintered glass filter adapter (without  humidity trap) [4] and to a vacuum line [5]. The activated cage sample is placed on the glass filter adapter and exposed for 3 days to SO 2 and H 2O vapor.  After, N 2 adsorption was evaluated (see Fig. S 15). In comparison to the reported for 6F -RCC3 cage,[2] the BET surface area decreased from 396 to 375 m2 g-1 after the exposure to SO 2 and H2O. No apparent changes were observed in porous organic cage after exposure to SO 2 and water stays  intact as confirmed by 1H NMR  (Fig. S13).",surface area
