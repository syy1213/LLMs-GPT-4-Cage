A 13C NMR s pectrum  was recorded  but signals cannot be assigned due to the large number of isomers. The spectrum is shown in Figure S40 .  S19 Synthesis of Carbon Cage Compound  17  A solution of nitro samine  cage 16 (207 mg, 0.11  mmol) in ethanol (90  mL) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (20% ( w/w), 90  mL) was heated to reflux . After the addition of sodium dithionite  (5.04  g, 29.0  mmol) in one portion the reaction mixture wa s kept under reflux for 12 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to r oom temperature and  water (100  mL) was added. After extraction of the aqueous suspension  with dichloromethane  (4 ℅ 50 mL) the organic layers were combined and dried over magnesium sulfat e. The solvent was rem oved under reduced pressure (10 mbar, 50∼C) and gave 143  mg of crude product. Compound 17 was isolated after purification by silic a gel column chromatography ( CH 2Cl2 100% , Rf = 0.93 ) as a colorless  solid (19 mg). Further purification via rGPC (CHCl 3, 40∼C, 5  mL/min) was applied and 5 mg of the product was obtained in 4% yield. Mp = 254∼C (dec.). 1H NMR  (300 MHz, CDCl 3): ??
