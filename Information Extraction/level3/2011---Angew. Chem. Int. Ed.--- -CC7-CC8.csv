"Reduction of CC7. An oven -dried round -bottom flask (500 mL) was cooled down to room temperature  under N 2; to this was added CC7  (350 mg, 0.1 mmol), CHCl 3 (30 mL), and MeOH (150 mL).

"[20Ã¿23]This elegant work has led tonanocontainers,[20,21]rhombicuboctahedral nanocapsules,[22]and a chiral nanocube[23]using structurally defined, ¡ùpro-hollow¡ì cavitands as building blocks. These organic moleculescan reach impressive sizes: for example, the [6 +8] giantrhombicuboctahedron[22]was estimated to have a solvody-namic diameter of 3.9 nm, and molecular models suggested acavity volume of around 4700 /C1383. Unfortunately, crystalssuitable for X-ray diffraction could not be obtained andstructures were therefore inferred from a combination ofNMR spectroscopy and molecular mechanics calcula-tions.",topology
"As shown in Figure 3b, there is no longer an interconnectedFigure 1. Single-crystal X-ray structures of CC7 and the [4 +6] tetra-hedral cage CC5[25](1 nm scale bar). The yellow octahedron andtetrahedron are included to visualize the shape of the cavity.",topology
"By contrast, MD simulations for solvent-free crystalstructures of the porous cages that we reported previously(CC2,[6]CC3,[6]andCC5[25]) showed that both the cage shapeand the interconnected porous channels were maintainedduring 5 ns NPT simulations (see the Supporting Informa-tion). This suggests that the force field is reliable and providesinteresting clues as to why some organic cages are shape-persistent and stable to desolvation, and others are not. Thesmaller [4+6] cages CC2 and CC3 lack the additionalflexibility provided by the tris(4-formylphenyl)amine unitsthat allow for bond rotation in the plane of the face. It istherefore highly unfavorable for a vertex to fold into the cagecavity. By contrast, in the larger [4+6] cage, CC5,[25]the sameflexible torsions observed in CC7 are present, and CC5 isindeed observed to be significantly more flexible in MDsimulations. However, the [4 +6] stoichiometry in CC5 resultsin a different topology and a much smaller cage voidcompared to the [8+12] cage, CC7. Although the cavity sizeinCC5 is sufficiently large to allow a vertex to fold inwards,there is no structural possibility of gaining intramolecular p-pstacking interactions between the arene faces (Figure S9).",topology
"[35]In essence, the single-crystal structures for CC7 andCC8represent cages in a ¡ùsea¡ì of solvent molecules. Hence, onemight expect similar structures to persist in true molecularsolutions. The1H NMR spectra of CC7 recorded at 20 8C andat 508C showed two distinct imine proton signals ( d=8.25and 8.35 ppm), instead of the single imine environmentobserved for the smaller [4+6] cages (Figure S24).[6,13]Thereare also two imine carbon resonances ( d=159.2 and159.3 ppm) in the13C NMR spectrum. This confirms thepresence of two distinct imine environments in the solutionstructure of the CC7 molecule that do not exchange on theNMR timescale, consistent with the crystal structure wherehalf of the imine protons point outwards (Figure S25) and theother half towards the interior of the cage ( 3£ªin Figure S25).",topology
"The formation of CC7 also demonstrates the strongsensitivity of dynamic covalent assembly reactions to smallchanges in the substrates. For example, a [4+6] cage ( CC5;Figure 1)[25]forms rather than the [8 +12]CC7 species when(R,R)-1,2-cyclopentanediamine is used in place of the cyclo-hexane analogue under otherwise similar reaction conditions.",topology
"The equivalent collapse mechanism is not possible for CC2 and CC3 as there is little freedom for rotation about the plane of the arene face compared to the t ri(4-formylphenyl) containing cages, as shown in Figure S25. This is further confirmed from the simulations where these Carene-Carene-Namine-Carene torsions in the face of CC7 are frozen, significantly stabilising the structure with respect to a total collapse and loss of porosity upon amorphization. However, there is a secondary problem in that there is a large energetic benefit towards CC7 collapsing with one vertex  folding in open itself, not only in increasing the attractive dispersive interactions between different parts of the cage molecules, but, perhaps more importantly, in facilitating the formation of Óð Ã¿ Óð stacking interactions from arene species on opposite  faces. Whilst this energetic benefit should in theory be possible for the tri(4 -formylphenyl) species in the smaller [4+6] CC5 molecule, the smaller size of CC5 compared to the [8+12] CC7 molecule means that whilst there may be space for a vertex to fold in this would not result in the formation of Óð Ã¿ Óð stacking interactions between arene species as they cannot align to each other (refer back to Figure S11 to compare the size of the speci es). Finally the CC7 structure does not collapse when solvated with DCM, it is suggested that this is a result of the DCM acting as a space filler or ¡ùscaffold¡ì, preventing the cage vertices folding inwards , rather than any special interaction between DCM and cage molecules.",topology
"As part of the future design process for hypothetical shape persistent cage molecules, computational screening of the stability of the cage to collapse can be envisaged. If a possible cage molecule is designed then a computer model can be built and MD simulations run to exmaine if the cage is shape persistent. There are several points that make this approach challenging; firstly the stoichiometry of the cages (for example [4+6] versus  [8+12] and so on) is not currently possible to predict ab initio  and secondly new cage chemistry may not be adequately described by available FF parameters and these large molecules are typically outside the reach of ab initio  molecular dynamics calculations due to the large computational expense.",topology
"[24]The cageswere obtained through [8 +12] imine condensation reactionsbetween two relatively simple precursors, tris(4-formylphe-nyl)amine (Scheme 1, A) and the chiral diamines ( R,R)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine ( B1) and ( R,R)-1,2-cyclohex-4-enedia-mine ( B2) to yield CC7 and CC8, respectively. The reactionoccurs without any additional template or catalyst (Scheme 1)to generate the A8B12cage in good yield (85¨C90%) throughformation of 24 new imine bonds.",topology
"In fact, disordered dichloromethane is the major consti-tuent of the crystalline phase and it occupies more than 70%of the available solvent-accessible volume¡ªin total, about75000 /C1383per unit cell. This amounts to around 80 and 75dichloromethane molecules per cage molecule for CC7 andCC8, respectively, although we cannot exclude the possibilitythat some of the protective medium, mesitylene, also diffusesScheme 1. One-pot [8 +12] synthesis of cages CC7 and CC8.",topology
"Both cages have tetrahedral Tsymmetry, and by defining thecentral amine nitrogen atoms in the 8 Aunits (Scheme 1) asnodes, its topology is equivalent to that of the [8 +12] chiralnanocube structure proposed by Warmuth.[23]The 8 triphenyl-amine moieties occupy the vertices and the 12 diamine linkersoccupy the edges of this highly distorted cube (Figure S4). Bycontrast, the molecular shape, as opposed to the topology, hasmore similarities with the structural model proposed for arhombicuboctahedral capsule.",topology
