General Remarks  All reagents and solvents were obtained from Fisher Scientific, Alfa Aesar, Sigma -Aldrich or VWR and were used without further purification unless otherwise noted. For thin layer chromatography silica gel 60 F 254 plates from Merck were used and examined under UV -light irradiation (254  nm and 365  nm). Flash column chromatography was performed on silica gel from Sigma -Aldrich (particle size: 0.04 -0.063  mm) using petroleum ether, ethyl acetate and dichloromethane . Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) was performed on BioBeads S -X1 from Bio -Rad Laboratories, Inc. using dichloromethane as solvent. Melting points (not corrected) were measured with a B®πchi Melting Point B -540. IR-Spectra were recorded on a Ge ATR crysta l with a Bruker Lumos spectrometer or on a Jasco FT/IR -4100 spectrometer.  NMR spectra were taken on Bruker Avance III 600 (1H NMR: 600  MHz; 13C NMR: 151  MHz), Avance III 500 (1H NMR: 500  MHz; 13C NMR: 125 MHz), Avance III 400 (1H NMR: 400 MHz; 13C NMR: 100  MHz), Avance DRX 300 and Avance III 300 (1H NMR: 300 MHz, 13C NMR: 75 MHz) spectrometer at 298 K, unless otherwise mentioned. Chemical shifts ( ¶ƒ) are reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to traces of CHCl 3 (¶ƒH = 7.26 ppm, ¶ƒC = 77.2  ppm) or Cl2CDCDCl 2 (¶ƒH = 5.96  ppm, ¶ƒC = 77.2  ppm) in  the corresponding deuterated solvent. HRMS experiments were carried out on a Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer solariX (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a 7.0 T  superconducting magnet and interfaced to an Apollo II Dual ESI/MALDI source or on a Bruker Autoflex Speed MALDI -TOF mass spectrometer with DCTB (trans -2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl) -2-methyl - 2-propenylidene]malononitrile) as matrix.  Elemental analysis was per formed by the Microanalytical Laboratory of the University of Heidelberg using an Elementar Vario EL machine.  Isophthalate S1[1], dimethanol S2[2], quinone S3[3], anthracene  S4[4], quinone 4[5], 1,3,5 -benzenetriboronic pinacolester S5[6] and benzene -1,3,5 -triyltriboronic acid 8[7] were synthesized by procedures published before.",this paper's author
