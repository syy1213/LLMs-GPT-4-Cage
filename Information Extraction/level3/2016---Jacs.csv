"¡öRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSynthesis and Characterization of the Cage Com-pounds. Purely organic trigonal-prismatic cages are relativelyuncommon, although they are one of the simplest possiblearchitectures known to date. The shape-persistent prismaticCC1rwas easily obtained ( ¡«80% yield) via the reaction of atriphenyl amine-based trialdehyde Cwith a chiral diamine D[(S,S)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine]. The aldehyde building block Cwas synthesized by palladium-catalyzed Suzuki ?Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of tris(4-bromophenyl)amine ( A) and 3-formylphenylboronic acid ( B)(Scheme 1 ). The imine-basedcage compound CC1 was isolated as a pale yellow solid bytreating Cwith Din a 2:3 stoichiometric ratio in chloroformunder re ?ux for 48 h. The dynamic nature of imine bonds ensuresthe formation of the thermodynamically most stable product inequilibrium, which herein involves condensation between 3equiv of diamine and 2 equiv of trialdehyde. Among all thepossible architectures, the molecular prism is enthalpicallyfavored owing to its having the least angle strain, as well asentropically favored as it comprises a minimum number ofbuilding blocks.",comprehensive synthesis
