Synthesis and Characteriza tion of Cage Compounds Synthesis of cage 3: Cage compound 2 (99 mg, 0.04 mmol), parafo rmaldehyde (191 mg, 6.3 mmol) and sodium borohydride (110 mg, 2.9 mmol) were susp ended under argon in dry THF (17 mL). TFA (5 mL, 64.9 mmol) was slowly added in a period of one hour at room temperature. The mixture was stirred 24 h at ro om temperature, cooled to 0 ¡ãC and a 25% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (30 mL), brine (20 mL) and dichloromethane (30 mL) were added. The layers were separated and the aqueous phase was extracted twice with dichloromethane (30 mL). The combined organic extract was dried with sodium sulphate and solvent was removed by rotary evaporation. Th e residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate (3 mL), and methanol (3 mL) was added. The preci pitate was collected by filtration and after drying in vacuum 65 mg (61%) of 3 was obtained as a wh ite solid.
