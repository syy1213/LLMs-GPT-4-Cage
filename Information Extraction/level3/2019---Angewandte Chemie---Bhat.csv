General remarks  All reagents and solvents were used without further purification unless otherwise noted.  2,7,14 -triaminotriptycene  2 was synthesized according to  a procedure reported in literature. [S1] For thin layer chromatography silica gel 60 F254 plates from Merck were used and examined under UV-light irradiation (254 nm and 365 nm). Flash column chromatography was done  using Silica gel 60 (40 ®C 63 ¶Ãm / 230 ®C 400 mesh ASTM) purchased from Macherey -Nagel  using dichloromethane  and methanol.  Recycling gel permeation chromatography was performed with a Shimadzu DGU -20A3R degassing unit, LC -20AD pump unit, CTO -20AC column oven, CBM -20A communication bus module, SPD -M20A diode array detector, FRC10A fraction collector, FCV -20AH2 valve unit, a PSS SDV (20 x 50 mm) precolumn and three SDV 100 ? (20 x 300 mm) columns connected in series . Melting  points (not corrected) were measured with a B®πchi Melting Point B -540. IR-Spectra were recorded on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer on a ZnSe ATR crystal. NMR spectra were taken on a Bruker Avance III 500 (500 MHz) and Bruker Avance III 600 (600 MHz) spectrometer. Chemical shifts ( ¶ƒ) are reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to traces of the nondeuterated solvent in the corresponding deuterated solvent. MALDI -TOF MS experiments were carried out on a Bruker Daltonik Reflex III, on a Bruker ApexQe  or on a Bruker AutoFlex Speed TOF with DCTB (trans -2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl) -2-methyl -2-propenylidene]malononitrile)  and dithranol ( 1,8-Dihydroxy -9(10H) -anthracenone ) as matrix . Electron micrographs were acquired using a Crossbeam 540 field emission scann ing electron microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Germany). Imaging was performed with a working distance of 3.0 mm and a landing energy between 1.0 keV and 3.0 keV. The secondary electron images were recorded by an Inlens -detector and the backscattered electron images recorded by an EsB -detector. The powder sample was suspended in isopropanol, treated with ultrasound and drop -casted onto a silicon wafer substrate pre -cleaned in air -plasma.
