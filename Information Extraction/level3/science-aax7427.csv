CC3 -S was dissolved in DCM (5 mg/mL) and added to an equivalent dichloromethane solution of 6ET -RCC3 -R at equal molar concentration ( 5.75 mg/mL). The solutions were mixed by direct addition at room temperature, with stirring. No precipitation was observed on mi xing, but the solution became cloudy after approximately 10 minutes. The co- crystal , Cocryst1, was collected by filtration ( Whatman? membrane filter PTFE, pore size 0.2 米m).

"52  2.14 Synthesis details of the isostructural cages   Synthesis of 1AT -5FT-RCC3.  1AT -RCC3  (200 mg, 0.17 mmol) solid was ground into fine powder and transferred into a 12 mL open glass vial. The open cage -containing vial was then placed into a larger 50 mL glass vessel that contained solid paraformaldehyde (200 mg). The glass vessel was sealed, and then heated at 60 ∼C in oil bath to generate a gaseous formaldehyde atmosphere. [ CAUTION:  formaldehyde is a class ｉ human carcinogen and it should only be handled in contained environment by trained personnel with suitable personal protective equipment ]. The reaction was left sealed at 60 ∼C for 12  hours, before the reaction was cooled to room temperature. The solid in the vial was retrieved and dried under dynamic vacuum  at 40 ∼C to remove the surface adsorbed formaldehyde. 1AT -5FT-RCC3 (crude yield = 205 mg, 97.5 %) was obtained as a crystalline white solid. 1H NMR (CDCl 3, 400 MHz) 汛 7.20每6.95 (m, 12H, -ArH), 4.14每3.86 (m, 12H, - ArCH 2), 3.45每3.00 (m, 12H, - ArCH 2 and  10 H, -NCH 2N-), 2.20每2.40 (m, 12H, CH on cyclohexane), 2.15每1.75 (m, 24H, CH 2 on cyclohexane), 1.40每1.00 (m, 24H, CH 2 on cyclohexane), 0.85每0.40 (m, 6H, CH 3) ppm; 13C NMR  (CDCl 3, 100 MHz): 汛 140.1, 123.6, 78.4, 68.8, 57.8, 57.3, 30.9, 29.4, 24.4 ppm.
