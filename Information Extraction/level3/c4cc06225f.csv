"The cage crystallized in a monoclinic crystal system with a C2/cspace group. The asymmetric unit is comprised of a half of cage 4along with several disordered solvent molecules. Solid state struc-tural examination revealed that the benzene rings of amine 2arein an almost eclipsed conformation and B13 ? apart, which canbe considered to be the length of t he cage.

In 1H NMR spectra chemical shift (¦Ä) values are enlisted in ppm relative to the TMS (0.00 ppm) as an internal standard  in CDCl 3. Bruker  ALPHA FTIR spectrometer was used for recording  IR spectra. High resolution  mass spectra wererecorded on a Q-TOF instrument by electrospray ionization (ESI) technique.Electronic absorption  and emission spectra were recorded  using a Perkin-Elmer LAMBDA 750 UV-visible  spectrophotometer and a HORIBA  JOBIN  YVON made Fluoromax-4 spectrometer, respectively.  All solvents used were of standardspectroscopic grade. Solution state quantum yield was estimated by comparing  with quinine sulphate  (?= 0.57 in 0.1 M H2SO 4).Solid  state quantum yield was obtained using ¡°Integrated  Sphere¡±  coupled with a HORIBA JOBIN YVON made  Fluoromax-4 spectrometer.",affiliation

"Cage 4: In a 250 mL round bottom flask, 180 mg (0.15mmol) of cage 3 was taken  in CHCl 3-MeOH (1:1, v/v) binary solvent mixture.  Into above reaction mixture,68 mg (1.8 mmol)  of NaBH 4 was added at room temperature and stirred for 1h followed by reflux  for 12h.After  completion of the reaction, solvent  was completely removed and the product was extracted in CHCl 3.Organic part was washed with water  for 3 to 4 times and dried over sodium  sulphate followed by removal of solvent to get white  solid.

Dynamic covalent imine chemistry has been utilized to synthesize afluorescent [3+2] self-assembled nanoscopic organic cage. Thefluorescent nature of the reduced analogue of the cage was furtherexploited for the highly selective detection of the explosive picricacid (PA).,topology
"Cage 4was synthesized by employing a one-pot Schi? basecondensation of 1,3,5-tris(aminomethyl)-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene(2)w i t h4 , 40-diformyltriphenylamine ( 1) followed by sodiumborohydride reduction of the imine bonds (Scheme 1). Theformation and purity of the synthesized cage 4were fullyexamined on the basis of1H NMR,13C NMR, FTIR, ESI-HRMSand X-ray crystallography. These results unambiguously corro-borate the formation of a [3+2] self-assembled cage (Fig. 1).",topology
