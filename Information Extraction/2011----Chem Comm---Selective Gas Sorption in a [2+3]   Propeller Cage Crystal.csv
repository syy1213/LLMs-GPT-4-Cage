"Synthesis procedure : An oven -dried 150 mL, two -necked round -bottom Ra dley flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar was flushed with N 2 gas and cooled to room temperature  under a N 2 flow. Tribromobenz ene (1 g, 3.18 mmol), 4 -formylphenylboronic acid (1.72 g, 11.5 mmol), Pd(OAc) 2 (3 m g, 0.013 mmol) , and PPh 3 (6 mg, 0.026 mmol) were added. After degassing  this mixture three times , 1-propanol (20 mL) was added under N 2. The solution was left stirring at 50 ∼C until all of the solids dissolved. Once the clear solution turned to pale yellow ( ca. 15 min), a solution o f Na 2CO 3 (2M, 6 mL) and water (5 mL) were added under N 2. The result ing mixture was then heated to reflux for 2 h under N 2. The nitrogen sources were removed after reflux and another portion of water (20 mL) was added. The reaction mixture was left under s tirring, open to the air for 5 h at room temperature. The mixture was then extracted with chloroform (30 mL) and the organic layers were washed with a 2% solution of NaHCO 3 (25 mL). A spoonful of activated charcoal was added into the organic solution and t he mixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature . The suspension was filtered through celite under reduced pressure.

"22Recently,Zhang et al. synthesized an organic cage molecule whichshowed high ideal CO 2/N2adsorption selectivity at 20 1Cand 1 bar.21Selectivities were good (CO 2/N2= 73) but theabsolute amounts of gas adsorbed were low. Zhang et al. alsoreported a series of related cage compounds which exhibitedideal CO 2/N2selectivity in the range from 36 to 138 at 20 1Cand 1 bar.18Mastalerz et al. described a salicylbisimine cagewith a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 1377 m2g/C01: this material showed a preference for CO 2over CH 4.15Likewise, the molecular crystal tris( o-phenylenedioxy)cyclo-phosphazene (TPP) adsorbed large amounts of CO 2and CH 4compared to N 2and H 2.20Cucurbit[6]uril was also shown toselectively adsorb CO 2over CO.19We recently demonstratedthat gas selectivities could be modulated in a single materialviapolymorph switching of an imine-based cage, CC1. Thiscage can be switched into any one of three polymorphic formswhich are, respectively, non-porous to both N2and H 2(CC1a), selectively porous to H 2only ( CC1b), and non-selectively porous to both N 2and H 2(CC1g).14Here, we describe the synthesis of a new propeller-shapedorganic cage, CC6. This molecule is synthesized by a one-step[2+3] cycloimination reaction of 1,3,5-tri(4-formylphenyl)benzene ( 1) with 1,5-pentanediamine ( 2) in methanol(Scheme 1). The product was isolated directly as a crystallinematerial after 1 week at room temperature.",surface area
"25Thissuggested potential applications in gas separations. For example,there is signi?cant interest in the separation of CO 2from N 2atambient temperature and pressure. The porous nature of CC6was therefore probed by N 2,H2,a n dC O 2sorption. First thematerial was heated to 100 1C under dynamic vacuum for 12 h tofully desolvate and degas the sample before gas sorption analysis.CC6 is stable under these conditions, with no apparent loss ofcrystallinity (Fig S6 w). N2sorption measurements at 77 Kshowed a predominantly Type I isotherm (Fig. 2) with a totaluptake of 1.5 mmol g/C01and a modest apparent BET surface areaof 99 m2g/C01. This is substantially lower than the [4+6] imine-based cages reported previously13because CC6 exhibits onlyextrinsic porosity (between cages) and no intrinsic porosity(within the cages).",surface area

"Compound CC6 crystallizes directly from the reactionmixture as colourless, plate-like prisms. The material is fullysoluble in chloroform and was characterized by1H and13C NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S4 and S5, Supportinginformation w). Mass spectrometry showed [ CC6 +H ]+and[CC6 + Na]+ions at m/z= 979.49 and 1001.48, consistentwith a [2+3] cage structure composed of two units of 1andthree units of 2with formula C 69H66N6. In previous work,13we showed the cycloimination reaction between 1,3,5-triformyl-benzene and either ethylenediamine, 1,2-propylenediamine, or1,2-cyclohexanediamine led to the formation of [4+6] cagestructures. Here, a [2+3] cage structure was observedinstead. We ascribe this to both the greater ?exibility of the1,5-pentanediamine and also the larger size of the trialdehyde.",topology
"Even though two 1,3,5-phenylbenzene groups are separatedby pentyl linkers, CC6 has a compact structure with little voidspace inside the ＆cage＊. As such, this [2+3] material di?ersfrom the [4+6] cages, CC1每CC3 , all of which are intrinsicallyporous6and have permanent cavities that can accommodateguests.13,14The distance between the two central phenyl ringsis 3.7 A ?, which is typical for p每pstacking.23The solvatedcrystal structure viewed along the c-axis shows a layered,p-stacked system (Fig. 1b). The distance between two layersin the crystal is approximately 5 A ?.CC6 assembles in the solidstate to generate one-dimensional (1-D) channels along thea-axis resulting from imperfect packing of the propeller-shapedmolecules. These extrinsic6pore channels are relatively narrowand constitute approximately 10% of the volume of thestructure. The MeOH solvent molecules can be identi?ed aselectron density within these voids, but these guests were onlypartially resolved and too disordered to be modelled e?ectively.The data was therefore treat ed by using PLATON/SQUEEZE24which calculates six MeOH molecules per cage molecule. Thep-stacked layers run perpendicular to the 1-D MeOH-?lledchannels. There is no connectivity between the channels andthe (negligible) void volume in the cage. A bulk sample of CC6was also analysed by powder X-ray di?raction (PXRD),con?rming it to be both phase pure and representative of thesingle crystal data in both solvated and desolvated forms.Compared with experimental di?raction data, the simulatedPXRD pattern showed systematic shifts in the peak positionsdue to thermal expansion because the single crystal and PXRDdata were collected at di?erent temperatures (Fig. S6 w). LeBail ?tting of PXRD data for CC6 after gas sorption showed agood agreement with PXRD data calculated from the singlecrystal structure (Fig. S7 w).",topology
"Gas sorption measurements were also carried out closer toambient temperature. The N 2adsorption isotherm at 300 Kand 1.2 bar revealed a low gas uptake (0.08 mmol g/C01). Bycontrast, the CO 2uptake for CC6 was 0.9 mmol g/C01under thesame conditions, signi?cantly greater than that reported forthe [2+3] cage prepared by Zhang et al. (0.1每0.25 mmol g/C01).18This adsorption behaviour suggests that CC6 or analoguesmight be candidates for gas separation applications. The idealselectivity was calculated from these isotherms to be 11 forCO2/N2at 300 K and 1 bar. In addition, the material had anideal selectivity for H 2over N 2of 2.4 at 77 K. The CO 2/N2selectivity for CC6 is low compared with the [2+3] imine cagesreported by Zhang et al. where ideal selectivities in the range36每138 were reported.18,21However, in considering materialsfor applications, absolute gas uptakes must also be considered.",topology
"29,30The single crystal structure recorded at 100 K with solventremoved was used for structural analysis and rationalisation ofthe observed gas selectivity. Unlike cucurbit[6]uril,19whereselectivity of CO 2over CO was rationalised on the basis of thehigh enthalpy of CO 2adsorption, we attri bute the selectivityobserved here to the crystal packing. The Connolly surfaceconstructed using a H 2probe radius of 1.42 A ?shows a 1-Dchannel with a fully connected ＆side pore＊ (Fig. 2a). Using aprobe radius of 1.72 A ?for CO2, a 1-D channel was observed buta narrow restricted neck to this side pore was observed. TheConnolly surface obtained using with a N2probe radius of1.82 A ?also demonstrated a narrow, restricted 1-D channel, butin this case the ＆side pore＊ was not connected to the channel(Fig. 2a). This could rationalize the lower uptake for N2and alsothe relatively high H 2uptake observed at 77 K. This behaviour isqualitatively similar to sorption in a [4+6] cage, CC1b.14In summary, we have demonstrated that a [2+3] imine-basedcage shows selectivity for CO 2over N 2at modest pressures.",topology
