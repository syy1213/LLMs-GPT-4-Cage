"Conventionally, symmetric tritopic monomers such as1,3,5-triformylbenzene ( i) have been commonly used toconstruct cages. By using these highly symmetric buildingblocks as vertices along with liner ditopic linkers, classic cages(such as T-symmetric [4+6] cage, OMC1 ) with one type ofsymmetric windows (W1) can be achieved (Figure 1).[2c]When the symmetry of the vertex is reduced, cage moleculeswith lower symmetries and more than one type of windowscan be obtained. For example, a tetra-aldehyde ( ii) with D2hvertex and the diamine linker ( iv) can be assembled into a D3hsymmetric trigonal prismatic cage OMC2 with two types ofsymmetric windows (W1 and W2): triangular and rectangularwindows.",topology

"The structure of the OMC3 was characterized by Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nuclear magneticresonance spectroscopy (NMR), and MALDI-TOF massspectrometry. FTIR analysis shows the conversion of alde-hyde and amine groups to imines (Supporting Information,Figure S2). The peaks at 1682 and 3342 cm/C01corresponding tothe stretching vibration of C =O and N /C0H are absent in the IRspectrum of the product. The new stretch peak at 1629 cm/C01appeared, confirming the formation of C =N bond. The NMRspectrum also indicates that the product does not containstarting amines and aldehydes (Supporting Information,Figures S3每S6). Although there are two types of chemicallyinequivalent imine protons, and aryl protons, the1H NMRspectrum obtained at 298 K shows four singlets at 7.94, 7.54,7.47 and 6.98 ppm in a 1:1:1:1 ratio for the aryl protons andfour singlets at 8.70, 8.60, 8.31 and 8.13 for the imine protons(Supporting Information, Figure S5). Such magnetic inequi-valence of the chemically equivalent protons suggests the highrigidity and low symmetry of the cage product. Althoughsome line broadening was observed in the1H NMR spectrumobtained at a lower temperature (273 K), the eight distinctsignals of the imine and aryl protons are still present at thesame peak positions, indicating minimal structural change andthe rigidity the cage molecule (Supporting Information,Figure S8). The nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectros-copy (NOESY) spectrum of the cage shows correlationsbetween spatially close protons, such as the hydroxyl protonsand imine protons, the imine protons and benzene ringprotons, and the imine protons and cyclohexane ring protons(Supporting Information, Figure S9). Owing to the rigidity ofthe cage, NOE effect was not observed between the arylprotons, which is consistent with the crystal structure.Diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) revealed the diffu-sion coefficients of the cage is 4.38 /C60.35 /C148 10/C010m2s/C01,corresponding to the effective hydrodynamic radius Rof9.3/C60.7 /C138 based on the Stokes-Einstein equation (Support-ing Information, Figure S10). This is in line with the observedcage dimensions in the crystal structure (Figure 2). TheMALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of the productshows the mass-to-charge ratio ( m/z) of 1987, matching withthe [[4+8]OMC3 +H]+(Supporting Information, Fig-ure S11).",topology

"To gain theoretical insights, the formation of the otherpossible cages, [2+4] cage (OMC4), [3 +6] cages (OMC5 andOMC6) were analyzed through density functional theory(DFT) calculation and compared to the formation of OMC3(Supporting Information, Figure S27). After the optimizationof molecular geometries, the entropy of symmetry ( Ssys) of the[4+8] cage ( OMC3 ) was 4.44 kJmol/C01less than that of themost common [3 +6] cage (OMC5), indicating that the [3 +6]cage (OMC5) is symmetry-entropically more favored than theOMC3 (Supporting Information, Table S4). However, ther-modynamic analysis of the conversion of OMC3 to othercages shows that although the formation of [4+8] cage(OMC3 ) is entropically less favored, it is more favoredenthalpically showing positive standard reaction enthalpy(DrHA) energy and positive standard reaction Gibbs energy(DrGA) (Table 1). We also monitored the reaction progress byanalyzing the solution phase using NMR spectroscopy(Supporting Information, Figure S7). We found all the start-ing materials were consumed within the first 5 minutes andthe cage product was gradually increased over the course of24 h. After 48 h, the ratio of OMC3 in the solution phase wasdecreased presumably because the precipitation of OMC3overrides its formation under a very low concentration.",topology

"4. Theoretical Study  Computations were performed by Gaussian 09 suites of programs and Multiwfn software.2,3 The geometries of [ 2+4] cage (b), [ 3+6] cages (b and c), and [ 4+8] cage were optimized by employing the B3LYP method with 3 -21G basis set.  The hydrogen atoms  of crystal structure were optimized by the B3LYP method with 3 -21G basis set . All optimized structures were characterized to be true local energy m inima on the potential energy surface without imaginary frequencies. QTAIM analysis were obtained using B3LYP -D3 methods with 6 -31+G(d) basis set based on the optimized structures.  To assure comparability of thermodynamic properties, we use the thermodynam ic data of optimized structure to carry on the thermodynamic analysis.",topology
