"The molecular structure of 1was finally confirmed by X-raysingle-crystal analysis.91crystallized in the chiral cubic spacegroup F4132, as indicated in Fig. 1a (CCDC 1515347, Fig. S1 andTables S1, S2, ESI ?).1consists of six cyclohexyl and fourhydroxyphenyl moieties interlinked viaimine groups. Notably,it featured a high symmetry that resulted in the appearance ofdisorder in certain parts. For example, the substituted hydroxylgroup was split over three positi ons and occupied three symmetricsites on the central phenyl ring. On the other hand, 1wasnanosized and possessed a ca.2 nm outer diameter and four ca.",CCDC
"Its phase purity was well demonstrated by the PXRD andSEM. All the obtained crystals of 1featured octahedral shape(Fig. S2, ESI ?) and its measured PXRD pattern is identical to thesimulated one (Fig. 1b), indicating that 1was obtained in a purephase.

"11We initially optimized the Ag@1 -catalyzed reaction condi-tions based on the nitrobenzene to azobenzene model reaction,in which alcohol was chosen as the reducing reagent with theaid of alkali. As shown in Table 1, the best result was obtainedwhen the reaction was carried out in the presence of Ag@1(8 mg, 1% mol Ag equiv.) and NaOH (3 mmol) in ethanol uponillumination with visible light (435 nm) for 9 h, and no moreyield change at a prolonged reaction time (Fig. 3a, Fig. S8,ESI?).

"As shown in Fig. 2a, the N2adsorption amounts by 1andAg@1 at 77 K are 112.6 and 69.4 cm3g/C01, respectively. Thecorresponding surface areas calculated on the basis of the BETmodel are 121.9 and 73.3 m2g/C01, respectively. The oxidationstate of the Ag species in Ag@1 was determined by X-rayphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and two peaks at 368.5 and374.5 eV corresponding to Ag 3d5/2and 3d 3/2demonstrated theexistence of Ag(0) in Ag@1 (Fig. S4, ESI ?).10In addition, high-resolution transmission electron micro-scopy (HRTEM) was used to investigate the Ag NP dispersionand size in Ag@1 . As indicated in Fig. 2b, the Ag NPs in Ag@1were highly dispersed with an average particle size of ca.2n m(over 400 Ag NPs counted). For determining the Ag NP location,the dynamic light scattering analysis (DLS) was performed on 1,Ag(I)@1 andAg@1 in their mother liquors (Fig. 2c). The particlesize of 1based on DLS was 2.18 nm which was well consistentwith its single-crystal analysis. More importantly, it indicatedthat 1in solution was stable and monodispersed. After the Ag( I)loading and reduction, the measured particle diameters ofAg(I)@1 and Ag@1 were centred at 2.21 and 2.33 nm respec-tively, which were comparable to those of 1and Ag NPs. Thisobservation suggested that most of the Ag( I)@1 and Ag@1existed as the monomer in solution under the given conditions.Thus, the loaded Ag NPs should be basically encapsulatedinside the cage of 1.",surface area

Besides NMR and IR (Fig. S1,ESI?), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) providedsubstantial evidence for the formation of a [4+6] cycloiminespecies. The MS spectrum showed that the peak at m/z1181.6656(calculated as 1181.6811) was observed due to the formation ofthe C72H84O4N12species (Fig. S1, ESI ?).",topology
