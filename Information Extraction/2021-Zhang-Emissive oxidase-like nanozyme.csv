"As shown in Scheme 1, the sca?old TPE-Cage 1was obtainedby reacting tetra(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethylene with cyanuric chlo-ride viaa two-step nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr)reaction according to our previous work.39,40Subsequently, theZn2+ions ligand 2,20-dipicolylamine (DPA) was introduced byreacting with the rest of the Cl groups at the outer rim of thesca?old TPE-Cage under the condition of K2CO3in tetrahydro-furan (THF), a?ording DPA-TPE-Cage in 90% yield. Thechemical structure of the DPA-TPE-Cage was clearly confirmedby nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. S2and S3, ESI ?), MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)and single crystal X-ray di?raction (SCXRD) analysis.

"Synthesis of DPA-TPE-Cage.  TPE-Cage (100 mg, 0.081 mmol), DPA (90 ¦ÌL, 0.486 mmol) and K2CO 3 (67 mg, 0.486 mmol) were added to a 50 mL round bottom  flask, and then THF (20 mL) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 24 h at 70 ¡æ. After  the raw materials was consumed,  the residue was filtered and purified  by S4column chromatography (dichloromethane/methanol,  8/1) to afford DPA-TPE-Cage as white solid  (134 mg, 81%). 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl 3) ¦Ä (ppm) = 8.57 (s, 8 H), 7.67 (m, 8 H), 7.35- 7.34(d, J = 7.8 Hz, 8 H), 7.21 (m, 16 H), 7.06- 7.04(d, J = 7.2 Hz, 4 H), 6.87- 6.85 (d, J = 7.8 Hz, 4 H), 6.80 (m, 8 H), 6.72- 6.71(d, J = 7.8 Hz, 4 H), 6.58-  6.57 (d, J = 7.8 Hz, 4 H), 5.20 (m, 8 H), 5.09 (m, 8 H). 13C NMR (150 MHz, CDCl 3) ¦Ä (ppm) = 171.33,  169.18, 156.73, 150.43, 149.85, 149.37, 140.29, 140.07, 138.81, 136.75, 132.73, 132.33,  129.92, 123.72, 122.38, 121.98, 121.77, 120.75, 119.71, 51.84.",comprehensive synthesis
