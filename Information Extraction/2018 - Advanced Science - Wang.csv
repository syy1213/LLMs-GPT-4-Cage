"Tetra(4 -hydroxyphenyl)ethylene 1 (1.00 g  2.52 mmol), 2,3,5,6 -Tetrachloropyridine 2 (1.09 g, 5.05 mmol) and Cs 2CO 3 (4.92 g, 15.2 mmol) were added to a 100 mL round bottom flask. DMSO (25 mL) was added, and then the combined mixture was stirred vigorously at 120 °„C overnight. After the raw materia ls was consumed, the reaction was allowed to cool down to RT, and the mixture was partitioned between CH 2Cl2 (40 mL) and H 2O (40 mL), separated, the aqueous layer was extracted twice with CH 2Cl2 (20 mL). The combined organics were dried over anhydrous Na 2SO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuum. The residue was purified by column chromatography (petroleum    3   ether/CH 2Cl2, 5/1) to afford TOC  as white solid (250 mg, 15 %).  MALDI -TOF-MS: m/z  1368 .2 (M+).",comprehensive synthesis

"To investigate the porous properties, the nitrogen sorption analysis of pTOC was conducted after desolvation at 120 °„ C for 10 h under vacuum. For pTOC, the BET surface area and pore volume were found to be 929 m2 g?1 (the Langmuir surface area is 1132 m2 g?1) and 0.612 cm3 g?1, respectively (Figure S7B, Sup-porting Information). Compared with nonporous TOC, the good porous structure of pTOC might have resulted from the poly-meric framework that overcome the window-to-arene stacking of TOC and fixed the pores position to keep the permanent porosity. The BET surface area of pTOC was higher than most of porous cages,[6,7,19] and comparable to some emissive porous organic polymers (POPs)[20] (Table S1, Supporting Information). The pTOC showed a steep nitrogen uptake at low relative pressure, implying the presence of micropores in their networks. Low-pres-sure hysteresis was extending to the lowest attainable pressures, which was associated with the irreversible uptake of gas mole-cules in the pores (or through pore entrances). This phenomenon probably means a swelling of polymer matrix at 77 K by nitrogen (Figure 3A). The pore size distribution calculated using Nonlocal Density Functional Theory (NLDFT) method (Figure 3B) also con-firmed the existence of micropores and mesopores, which might result from the intrinsic porosity and expanded networks of the cage monomers. It was worth noting the presence of micropores with an average size of 5.8 ?, which might have originated from the intrinsic cavity of TOC and was in agreement with the crystal-lographic analysis (Figure S4, Supporting Information).",surface area
