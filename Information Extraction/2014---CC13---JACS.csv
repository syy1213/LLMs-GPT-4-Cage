"Synthesis. CC1 and CC2 were synthesized as previouslydescribed24,48and recrystallized from a 2:1 mixture of dichloro-methane and 1,4-dioxane. CC2 is synthesized from the racemicpropane 1,2-diamine. CC13 : 2-Methyl-1,2-propanediamine (1.529 g,0.0173 mol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (450 mL) in a 2 Lround-bottomed ?ask cooled in an ice bath. 1,3,5-Triformylbenzene(1.875 g, 0.0116 mol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (575 mL) in apressure-equalized dropping funnel and added dropwise over 24 h tothe 2-dimethyl-1,2-propanediamine solution with stirring.

"24Other porous organic cages were also described recently,prepared both via imine condensation,25?28and by directcarbon ?carbon bond formation.29The rapid development ofthis?eld since 2009 is demonstrated by the increase in surfaceareas attained for organic cage molecules, with surfaces areas ashigh as 2071 m2g?1reported by Mastalerz et al.30The samegroup also prepared a hydrogen-bonded molecular solid with aremarkable surface area of more than 2800 m2g?1.18A distinguishing feature of porous organic molecules15is thatthey can be dissolved in common solvents, allowing processingoptions that are unavailable for insoluble frameworks. Solubilityallows porous organic cages to be combined in a modular way,creating binary31and also ternary porous cocrystals.32Cagemolecules can also be cast into composite membranes33andincorporated into macroporous supports.34Porous organiccages were also shown to act as perfect molecular sieves forcertain C9 aromatic hydrocarbons35and as components insensor devices.36,37The vertex functionality in cage molecules can dictate boththe crystal packing and the topology of the resulting porenetwork. For example, a cyclohexane functionalized imine cage,CC3-R, packs in a window-to-window arrangement to generatea 3-D diamondoid pore network.",surface area
"Both polymorphs show a type I nitrogen sorption isothermwith a sharp, low-pressure step, indicative of a microporoussolid (Figure 3). Desolvated CC2¦Âis also porous to othergases, such as CH4,C O2, and H2, to a similar level as observedforCC2¦Á(SI, Figures S1 ?S3); however, CC2¦Âexhibits asigni?cantly lower uptake of nitrogen than CC2¦Á, and aconcomitantly lower surface area (330 m2g?1compared with533 m2g?1).CC2¦Âalso exhibits a greater slope in theadsorption branch of the isotherm at higher relative pressuresand more pronounced hysteresis in the desorption isotherm.",surface area
"CC2¦Â:E?ect of Crystallization Conditions on Micro-porosity. The precise crystallization conditions that are usedto prepare the CC2¦Âmaterial can also substantially a ?ect theporosity. Samples of CC2¦Âshowed variable gas uptakesbetween batches. In principle, the desolvation method mighta?ect the degree of cracking (Figure 4) and, hence, the totalporosity, but this was ruled out in a parallel synthesis study (SIFigure S4), which showed that the method of desolvation hadno statistically signi ?cant e ?ect on porosity. By contrast, themethod used for crystal growth had a major in ?uence, as shownby comparing slow-crystallized samples of CC2¦Âwith materialsthat were precipitated more rapidly from solution by rotaryevaporation of solvent (Figure 6). The apparent BET surfacearea of the rotary evaporated sample (720 m2g?1) was morethan twice as high as the slowly crystallized sample (330 m2g?1). However, powder di ?raction analysis for these twosamples suggests, super ?cially, rather little di ?erence betweenthe two samples, although close inspection does show broaderpeaks in the PXRD data for the sample produced by rapidcrystallization.",surface area
"Nitrogen sorption isotherms for desolvated samples derivedfrom the CC1 ¡¤1,4-dioxane solvate show signi ?cant micro-porosity (Figure 9), whereas previous polymorphs CC1¦Á24andCC1¦Â61are nonporous to N 2. The apparent BET surface areaof 333 m2g?1is comparable with CC2¦Â. Hence, despitechanges in the crystal packing upon desolvation, a connectedpore structure is maintained. This would be expected from thesolvent-accessible surface for an in silico desolvated structure(Figure 10); that is, notallowing for any structural rearrange-ments. Again, the number of nitrogen molecules adsorbed percage at P/P0= 0.1 is 2.7, in fair agreement with the three N2molecules per cage that would correspond to an idealized andfully occupied structure. The desolvated CC1 material is alsoporous to hydrogen (SI, Figure S8).",surface area
"40The cause of these steps is not yetfully understood, but we believe they are due to a subtle phasetransition at low pressure, which will be addressed in futurework. The apparent BET surface area was 517 m2g?1, and thegas uptake was 9.2 mmol g?1atP/P0= 0.99, but only 1.1 mmolg?1in the micropore range at P/P0= 0.1. The crystal habit ofFigure 9.

As for CC1 and CC2 , the dioxane-directedcrystallization induced window-to-window packing in theCC13 solvate. Powder X-ray di ?raction showed little structuralchange upon removal of 1,4-dioxane (SI Figure S9 ?11),yielding a desolvated polymorph, CC13 ¦Â(Figure 14a).",surface area
"As for CC13 ¦Á, the geminal methyl groups are disordered andre?ne with 50% occupancy in the two possible vertex sites. Onemolecule of 1,4-dioxane sits inside each cage, with another fourmolecules of 1,4-dioxane positioned in each cage window, justas for the CC2¦Â¡¤1,4-dioxane solvate. A type I isotherm with nosteps was observed for desolvated CC13 ¦Âstructure, along witha much higher gas uptake at low relative pressures (Figure 12).In our ?rst preparation of CC13 ¦Â,CC13 was dissolved indichloromethane, 1,4-dioxane was added, and then the solventswere removed by simple evaporation from an open vessel in afumehood. This gave an apparent BET surface area of 946 m2g?1, almost double that of the CC13 ¦Ápolymorph. The N 2uptake was 13.5 mmol g?1atP/P0= 0.99 (10.5 mmol g?1atP/P0= 0.1; Figure 12, blue points). The low-pressure uptakecorresponds to 10.1 N 2molecules per cage: a dramatic increaseover the ¡«3N 2per cage for CC1 andCC2 in the same packingarrangement. A concern, therefore, was that this stemmed fromcrystal defects, as discussed above for CC2¦Â. Therefore, furthercrystallizations of CC13 were performed using slow, carefullycontrolled solvent evaporation under a nitrogen ?ow.",surface area
"This more careful crystallization procedure gave much moreuniform, octahedral crystals (Figure 13b, c); however, thesemore regular crystals showed a higher level of microporosity(Figure 12, red points). Hence, crystal defects cannot beresponsible here for the extra porosity in CC13 ¦Â. The highlycrystalline sample had an apparent BET surface area of 1173 m2g?1, with an N2uptake of 15.3 mmol g?1atP/P0= 0.99 (11.6mmol g?1atP/P0= 0.1), corresponding to 11.1 N 2per cagemolecule. By comparison, high-crystallinity CC3, which packsisostructurally, has a BET surface area of ¡«400 m2g?1;6311 N2molecules per cage cannot be rationalized on the basis of asingle diamondoid pore channel, as observed for CC2¦ÂandCC3.",surface area
"18Interpenetration of pore channels represents a di ?erentstrategy for increasing guest uptakes, and all other porousorganic cages with surface areas of more than 1000 m2g?1haverelied on increasing the size of the cage units themselves.30,31However, increasing the cage size can result in a concomitantdecrease in solubility (e.g., for CC5),31thereby limitingprocessability. By contrast, the disordered, geminal methylgroups in CC13 strongly increase the solubility with respect toits close structural analogues. Indeed, CC13 is highly soluble inchlorinated solvents, and it has a much higher solubility (cf.,CC1,CC2, and CC3) in nonhalogenated solvents, such asmethanol and tetrahydrofuran. The solubility of CC13 wasmeasured by1H NMR by comparison with an internal standardand was found to be around 20 times higher in chloroform thanCC3 (200 mg/mL; cf., 9 mg/mL for CC3). Likewise, thesolubility of CC13 in methanol and in tetrahydrofuran was 5and 17 mg/mL, respectively (SI Table S3), whereas CC3 isbarely soluble at all in those solvents.",surface area

" 1.3. Computational details for defect investigation s  To investigate the effect of different crystal defects, which would lower crystallinity, a unit cell of CC3 -R was edited to incorporate a variety of different potential defects. The surface area was then calculated using Zeo++ with a probe radius of both 1.82 and 1.6 ? and compared to the SCXRD structure of CC3 -R. The case was an NPT MD simulation at 750 K, S19  1 atm for 20 ns (with setup otherwise as described in Section 1.2 above), the final structure from the simulation was then analyzed ; this corresponds to a thermally annealed system . The next case was delet ion of  a single CC3  molecule from the center of the simul ation cell, followed by  geometry optimization of  the cell in Forcite using CSFF (setup otherwise as described Section 1.2 above). In another case, a  translational defect was formed by shifting half of the unit cell (4 cages) by a/8 and then geometry optimi zing the cell. A rotational defect was introduced by rotating a single CC3  molecule by approximately 90¡ã and then geometry optimizing  the cell. Finally, we attempted to reduce the crystallinity by geometry optimizing  the cell under an external pressure of 10 GPa , and then geometry optimizing  the resultant structure without the external pressure. Loss of crystallinity through pressure -induced amorphization has previously been observed experimentally for  metal organic frameworks (MOFs).9  2. Computational res ults and discussion  2.1. Calculated surface areas  For these porous molecular  materials, which are particularly flexible  and not interconnected by covalent or coordination bonds , we do not expect calculated surface areas to correspond exactly with experimentally  determined  BET surface areas . Indeed , other computational studies have found that uptakes are overestimated compared to experimental values.10 It is more difficult to consider the CC1  systems , such  as CC1¦Á and CC1¦Â , which are barely porous to N 2 at 77  K (BET surface area < 30 m2 g-1). Also,  CC1 .dioxane can not be desolvated  without structural rearrangement . Nonetheless, t he results in Table S 4 and Figure S20 show that, for the rest of the systems, the surface area is generally somewhat overest imated compared to experiment when calculated using  the smaller probe radius of 1.6 ? (equivalent to the van der Waals radius of a single N atom), but underestimated with a larger probe radius of 1.82 ? (equivalent to the kinetic radius of N 2). Indeed, for  CC2¦Â , CC3 -R, and CC13¦Á , the BET surface area is bracketed by the se two calculated values. For CC2¦Á , both of the calculated values exceed the BET surface area, but for this system there is an added complication of the unknown contribution of formally inaccessible cage voids, as we discussed previously.11  S20   Figure S20 ¨C A comparison of experimental surface areas (black circle ) and those calculated with a probe radius of 1.82  ? (red square) and 1.6 ? (smaller pale red square).  In all cases, data refer t o the most crystalline samples obtained using slow crystallization conditions. Note that the CC1.dioxane  points refer to artificially, in silico  desolvated structures: since the structure rearranges on desolvation, the corresponding experimental data point  does not exist.",surface area
"? in silico desolvated; ? disorder left in the structure   By comparison, for CC13¦Â , both of the calculated values are lower  than the experimental BET surface area of 1173 m2 g-1, although  the calculated value with the smaller probe radius is, within error, essentially  the same as experiment  (1135 m2 g-1). This would suggest that , in order to rationalize  the porosity for CC13¦Â , it is necessary to assume that all of the calculated void space is accessible, despite the fact that , even with the smaller probe radius of 1.6 ?, there is a calculated contribution of unconnected void space of 523 m2 g-1 to the total surface area (46% of total surface area). We investigate in the  following section whether these formally inaccessible voids, which are entirely in the extrinsic void  space, can become interconnected during molecular dynamics simulations , and hence effectively double the porosity. A preliminary investigation of a visualization  of surface area for CC13¦Â  as the probe size is decreased to 1.53 ? suggests that the first po int at which the occluded extrinsic voids will become interconnected across a unit cell occurs when a small pathway opens up between the extrinsic sites, which would suggest a secondary diamondoid pore network between the occluded sites (see Figure S14  and Movie 3). This secondary network is not joined to the primary diamondoid network running through the cages and would therefore System  BET surface area  (m2 g-1) Surface area calculated with a 1.82 ? probe radius (m2 g-1) Surface area calculated with a 1.6 ? probe radius (m2 g-1) ISA Total  ISA Total  CC1 ¦Á 20 0 172 0 343 CC1 ¦Â 30 0 282 0 635 CC1 .dioxane ? n/a 948 948 1392  1408  CC2 ¦Á? 533 0 730 740 1018  CC2 ¦Â? 320 0 199 405 422 CC3 -R 400 0 286 527 527 CC13 ¦Á? 517 0 398 505 779 CC13 ¦Â?,? 1173  420 762 612 1135  S22  suggest an unusual doubly interpenetrated pore network for this system. Indeed, when we created a randomized  structure without the disorder of dimethyls on the vertices, we start to see pathways begin to open between occluded sites for a probe size of 1.82 ? (see Figure 16b, with the thin cyan lines beginning between occluded sites.) We investigate this pore structure further with MD simulations with gases in section  2.2.",surface area
"Performing a high temperature MD simulation for 20 ns at 750 K lowers the order of the cages slightly, but this only increases the surface area margin ally, by 6%. However, there was one defect that significantly increased the surface  (by ~78%; an increase of 273 m2 g-1), which delet ion of  a single cage molecule from the cell . This is equivalent to 12.5% of the cage sites not being occupied , which we do not expected to be physically likely in a real S24  crystal, but which shows that point vacancies can contribute in principle to enhanced surface area. We also note that such defects would not be observed in PXRD patterns or in SC-XRD structures since they woul d be averaged over a bulk structure. We have not investigated here other macroscopic defects such as grain boundaries and dislocations , since the simulation of this is beyond the scope of this study,  but it is likely that such defects  also contribute to porosity in samples with imperfect crystallinity .",surface area

For metal ?organic frameworks and covalentorganic frameworks, this has been addressed by using strong,directional intermolecular bonding to create families ofisoreticular solids. Here, we show that an organic directingsolvent, 1,4-dioxane, has a dominant e ?ect on the latticeenergy for a series of organic cage molecules. Inclusion ofdioxane directs the crystal packing for these cages away fromtheir lowest-energy polymorphs to form isostructural, 3-dimensional diamondoid pore channels. This is a unique function of thesize, chemical function, and geometry of 1,4-dioxane, and hence, a noncovalent auxiliary interaction assumes the role ofdirectional coordination bonding or covalent bonding in extended crystalline frameworks. For a new cage, CC13 , a dual,interpenetrating pore structure is formed that doubles the gas uptake and the surface area in the resulting dioxane-directedcrystals.",this paper's author
