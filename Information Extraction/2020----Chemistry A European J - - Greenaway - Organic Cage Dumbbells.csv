"Single crystal X -ray Diffract ion: Single crystal X -ray data for OCD1 , crystallised from CHCl 3/MeCN, was measured  at beamline I19, Diamond Light Source, Didcot, UK using silicon double crystal monochromated synchrotron radiation (竹 = 0.6889 ?, Dectris Pilatus 2M detector). The crystals  were unstable out of the crystallisation solvent and the X -ray data was recorded after flash freezing a crystal at 100 K. D ata reduction and empirical absorption corrections were performed with xia2.4 The s tructures were solved with SHELXT5 and refined by full -matrix least squares on | F|2 by SHELX L,6 interfaced through the programme OLEX2 .7 All non -H-atoms of OCD1  were refined anisotropically . All H-atoms were fixed in geometrically estimated positions and refined using the riding model. A Supplementary  CIF, that i nclude structure factor  data , is available free of charge from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif  (deposition number : 1952665 ).",CCDC

Due to radiation damage, only one  scan was used to generate the reflection file . As a result, d ata completeness is poor (71%). In addition, due to twinning, t he reflection file was detwinned using TwinRotMat function in Platon,8 and refined as a 2 -component twin (HKLF 5) with BASF refined to 0.390(4) . Due to severe disord er, all aromatic rings were refined with constrained geometries (AFIX 66 in SHELX), and the structure was refined with a rigid -bond restraint (RIGU in SHEL). The disorder and poor sample quality account for the high R-values. Addition solvent molecules, wh ich could not be modelled as CHCl 3, were refined as disordered O -atoms. Disordered solvent also accounts for the high R -values. For a displacement ellipsoid plot, see Figure S12 .

For quantities in each reaction see Table S 2. The resulting solutions were  heated to 40 ∼C for 3 days, before being allowed to cool to room temperature. The s uspensions were filtered to remove insoluble precipitates before crude aliquots were taken for analysis by LCMS  to determine the ratio of B1 to OCD  formed  每 see Table S2  and Figure S2.
