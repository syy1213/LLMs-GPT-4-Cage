You are a text classifier that classifies paragraphs into nine categories based on what they contain:
1. this paper's author: Containing information about the author of this paper (There are many consecutively occurring names, the last of which must be followed by an asterisk). Generally this category of paragraph appears earlier in the article.
2. extra author: Containing authors of other articles, such as background descriptions.
3. comprehensive synthesis: Containing comprehensive experimental conditions of the chemical reaction. The chemical reaction conditions must appear with clear information about the reaction temperature, reaction time, reactants, products, solvents, and their amounts. Note in particular that the amount is mandatory. This means that if neither volume, weight nor molarity is mentioned in the text, it cannot be attributed to this category.
4. incomprehensive synthesis: Containing incomprehensive experimental conditions of the chemical reaction. (also a reaction condition, but without very complete information) 
5. CCDC: Containing CCDC number (The text generally contains the word "CCDC" followed by a string of numbers.)
6. surface area: Containing information on the specific surface area of a compound. (The text generally contains the word "m2/g".)
7. affiliation: Containing information about the author's organization, city, or nationality, etc.
8. Ref: Containing references.
9. others: paragraphs which fall into none of the previously mentioned categories.

Some examples of paragraphs are given below, along with the corresponding categories, so that you can study them in order to later classify the paragraphs given to you.

Reduction of CC7. An oven-dried round-bottom flask (500 mL) was cooled down to room temperature under N2; to this was added CC7(350 mg, 0.1 mmol), CHCl3 (30 mL), and MeOH (150 mL). The resulting suspension was stirred at room temperature for 10 min, NaBH4 (185 mg, 50 mmol) was added slowly. The reaction mixture was then stirred at room temperature under N2 overnight.
category: comprehensive synthesis

paragraph:
Synthesis of Pd@CC1r Catalyst. In a typical synthetic protocol, 40mg (0.03 mmol) of CC1r dissolved in 6 mL of CHCl3 was treated with 4 mL of a CHCl3 solution of 20 mg (0.09 mmol) of Pd(OAc)2 for 1 h. Into this reaction mixture was added a methanolic solution of NaBH4 (24.3 mg, 0.18 mmol) dropwise at room temperature, followed by stirring for 20 min.
category: comprehensive synthesis

paragraph:
The cages were obtained through [8+12] imine condensation reactions between two relatively simple precursors, tris(4-formylphenyl)amine (Scheme 1, A) and the chiral diamines (R,R)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine (B1) and (R,R)-1,2-cyclohex-4-enediamine (B2) to yield CC7 and CC8, respectively. The reaction occurs without any additional template or catalyst (Scheme 1)to generate the A8B12 cage in good yield (85 – 90%) through formation of 24 new imine bonds.
category: incomprehensive synthesis

paragraph:
To achieve this first synthetic goal, hexamethoxytriptycene 1 was partially oxidized to the quinone 2 and condensed with phenylene diamine 3 to give phenazine 4 in 79% yield.

CC20 was obtained by the self-assembly of 8 molecules of 2-hydroxy-1,3,5-triformylbenzene (HO-TFB) with 12 molecules of cis-1,3-CHDA.
category: incomprehensive synthesis

paragraph:
The organic cages are formed by reacting 1,3,5-triformylbenzene with different vicinal diamines (Scheme 1a). For CC2, CC3 and CC4, the chirality of the diamine controls the helical chirality of the cage molecule, whereas CC1 and CC13 are synthesised using achiral diamines and prepared as helical racemates.
category: incomprehensive synthesis

paragraph:
We report herein a [2+3] phosphate organic cage (cage 1) via the Schiff-base condensation between a phosphate based trialdehyde with a unique tetrahedron geometry and (1R,2R)-(-)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine (Scheme 1).
category: incomprehensive synthesis

paragraph:
One can also carry out chemistry on these systems: for example, CC7 can be cleanly reduced to its amine form at room temperature using NaBH4 in a mixture of CHCl3 and MeOH, as supported by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (Figures S29 and S30).

paragraph:
The apparent BET surface area of the rotary evaporated sample (720 m2/g) was more than twice as high as the slowly crystallized sample (330 m2/g).
category: surface area

paragraph:
The Langmuir surface area calculated for 2 from the N2 isotherm was 600 m2/g and the Brunauer Emmett Teller surface area (SABET) was 533 m2/g. Cage 3 also shows a type I N2 sorption isotherm with a corresponding Langmuir surface area of 730 m2/g (SABETD 624 m2/g).
category: surface area

paragraph:
The specific BET surface area is with 443 m2/g much larger than accessible by thermal activation and comparable to smaller cages e.g. from Cooper et al. , but significantly lower than for larger cages. Furthermore, the material adsorbs 0.93 wt% H2 (at 77 K and 1 bar), 13.8 wt% CO2 and 2.17 wt% CH4 (both at 273 K, 1 bar). All derived polymer materials have been investigated by nitrogen sorption at 77 K, turning out to be of low porosity with specific surface areas below 26 m2/g. 
category: surface area

paragraph:
Therefore, both cage compounds have been investigated by gas sorption. Thermal treatment (120 °C for 3 h) under vacuum led not to a reasonable activation of the pores. In each case, the apparent specific surface area (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller model) never exceeded 11 m2/g (3-Et-Et) or 27 m2/g (3-Et-H) as measured by nitrogen sorption at 77 K.

CC7 crystallizes in the cubic space group P213 with two crystallographically independent molecules, each located on a 3-fold axis (Figure S3). CC8 crystallizes isostructurally, with slightly reduced unit cell parameters. The cage molecules CC7 and CC8 are packed only loosely into the three-dimensional structure (Figure 2), giving rise to large internal and external voids which are filled with the solvent dichloro-methane.

paragraph:
Both cages have tetrahedral Tsymmetry, and by defining thecentral amine nitrogen atoms in the 8 Aunits (Scheme 1) asnodes, its topology is equivalent to that of the [8+12] chiralnanocube structure proposed by Warmuth. The 8 triphenyl-amine moieties occupy the vertices and the 12 diamine linkers occupy the edges of this highly distorted cube (Figure S4). By contrast, the molecular shape, as opposed to the topology, has more similarities with the structural model proposed for arhombicuboctahedral capsule.

paragraph:
In both polymorphs, the cages are packing mainly via CH-π and dispersion interactions (Figure 1b).In polymorph α, a three-dimensional pore system can be found whereas for polymorph β pores are isolated and thus not accessible. The pores in polymorph α are strongly winded and contain a number of dead-ends.

paragraph:
The observed [2+3] over the expected [4+6] selectivity remains opposed to the previously postulated “odd–even” rule and is attributed to the presence of three OH groups in each aromatic ring.
