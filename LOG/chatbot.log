Input: 
What is the reducing agent for the conversion of CC3 to RCC3?
Output:
The reducing agent used for the conversion of CC3 to RCC3 is sodium borohydride (NaBH4).

Input: 
Please tell me briefly the exact synthesis route.
Output:
1. Dissolve the imine cage CC3-R (926 mg, 0.83 mmol) in a chloroform/methanol mixture (1:1 v/v, 50 mL) and stir until the solution becomes clear.
2. Add sodium borohydride (1.00 g, 26.5 mmol) to the clear solution and stir for 12 hours at room temperature.
3. Add water (2 mL) to the reaction mixture and stir for an additional 12 hours.
4. Remove the solvent under vacuum.
5. Extract the resulting white solid with chloroform (2 ¡Á 50 mL).
6. Combine the organic phase and wash it with water (2 ¡Á 100 mL).
7. Dry the chloroform phase using anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) before removing it under vacuum.
8. RCC3 (crude yield = 900 mg, 95.1%) is obtained as a white solid.
9. Purify RCC3 using a reversible reaction with acetone:
   - Dissolve 1000 mg of crude RCC3 in 100 mL of acetone and allow the solution to stand.
   - Crystals start to appear on the wall of the flask after 30 minutes.
   - Collect the crystals (AT-RCC3) after one day by filtration.
   - Dissolve the crystals again in a chloroform/methanol mixture (1:1 v/v) and stir.
   - Add several drops of distilled water to the solution and stir for another 12 hours.
   - Remove the solvents to recover pure RCC3 (680 mg, 70.4%).
This process effectively converts CC3 to RCC3 using sodium borohydride as the reducing agent.
