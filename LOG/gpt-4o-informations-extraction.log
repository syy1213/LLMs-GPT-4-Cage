"Here weself-assembled ananionic cage bycombiningGa3+cation, trishydrazide andsalicy laldehyde ina[6++4++12]manner .Thecage bears twelve sulfonic acidunits,endowingwater solubility .Thehydrazone bonds within thecage frame-work were observed toberemarkably robust inwater, helpingtoavoid hydrolysis that often occurs insome oftheself-assembled systems containing typical imine .Ontheonehand,thewater -compatibility allows thecage totake advantage ofhydrophobic effect torecognize guests inaqueous media. Ontheother hand, thenegative charges onthecage help toenhance thebinding affinity ofcage toaccommodate cationicguests ,some ofwhich areconsidered difficult toberecog-nized inwater duetotheir hydrophilicity .Different from mostofthepreviously reported coordination hosts ,[14]thecageprovides theguests with two binding modes ,ineitherinclusion orperipheral[15]manner ,orboth.Theconsequenceisthat, thecage isable torecognize awiderange ofguests ,whose sizes could beeither smaller than, orexceed thevolume oftheinner cavity ofthecage.Within theframeworkofasingle cage,allofthefour trishydrazone ligands ofthecage adopt thesame rotational conformation, andthesixGa3+vertexes have thesame axial chirality .Suchbehaviorsendow thecage homochirality ,andthecage product istherefore actually aracemic mixture oftwo homochiralenantiomers .Upon recognizing achiral guest, either inter-nally orexternally ,oneofthecage enantiomers became morethermodynamically favored than theother, producing CDsignals forchirality sensing .Theenantiomeric excess (ee)values ofavariety ofenantiomer mixtures could bedeter -mined quantitatively ,byrecording theCDsignal intensities .[*]G.Wu,Y.Chen, S.Fang,L.Tong,L.Shen, C.Ge,Prof. Y.Pan,Prof. H.LiDepartment ofChemist ry,Zhejiang Universi tyHangzhou 310027 (China)E-mail :lihao2015@zju .edu.cnX.ShiCollege ofGeograp hyandEnvironmen t,Shandong Normal Univer-sityJinan 250358 (P.R.China)Supportin ginforma tion andtheORCID identifica tion number(s) fortheauthor(s) ofthisarticle canbefound under :https ://doi.org/ 10.1002/ani e.2021041 64.",affiliation

"22Recently,Zhang et al. synthesized an organic cage molecule whichshowed high ideal CO 2/N2adsorption selectivity at 20 1Cand 1 bar.21Selectivities were good (CO 2/N2= 73) but theabsolute amounts of gas adsorbed were low. Zhang et al. alsoreported a series of related cage compounds which exhibitedideal CO 2/N2selectivity in the range from 36 to 138 at 20 1Cand 1 bar.18Mastalerz et al. described a salicylbisimine cagewith a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 1377 m2g/C01: this material showed a preference for CO 2over CH 4.15Likewise, the molecular crystal tris( o-phenylenedioxy)cyclo-phosphazene (TPP) adsorbed large amounts of CO 2and CH 4compared to N 2and H 2.20Cucurbit[6]uril was also shown toselectively adsorb CO 2over CO.19We recently demonstratedthat gas selectivities could be modulated in a single materialviapolymorph switching of an imine-based cage, CC1. Thiscage can be switched into any one of three polymorphic formswhich are, respectively, non-porous to both N2and H 2(CC1a), selectively porous to H 2only ( CC1b), and non-selectively porous to both N 2and H 2(CC1g).14Here, we describe the synthesis of a new propeller-shapedorganic cage, CC6. This molecule is synthesized by a one-step[2+3] cycloimination reaction of 1,3,5-tri(4-formylphenyl)benzene ( 1) with 1,5-pentanediamine ( 2) in methanol(Scheme 1). The product was isolated directly as a crystallinematerial after 1 week at room temperature.",surface area
"25Thissuggested potential applications in gas separations. For example,there is signi?cant interest in the separation of CO 2from N 2atambient temperature and pressure. The porous nature of CC6was therefore probed by N 2,H2,a n dC O 2sorption. First thematerial was heated to 100 1C under dynamic vacuum for 12 h tofully desolvate and degas the sample before gas sorption analysis.CC6 is stable under these conditions, with no apparent loss ofcrystallinity (Fig S6 w). N2sorption measurements at 77 Kshowed a predominantly Type I isotherm (Fig. 2) with a totaluptake of 1.5 mmol g/C01and a modest apparent BET surface areaof 99 m2g/C01. This is substantially lower than the [4+6] imine-based cages reported previously13because CC6 exhibits onlyextrinsic porosity (between cages) and no intrinsic porosity(within the cages).",surface area

As for porous polymer membranes, atrade-o? between sorption capacity and selectivity is observedfor materials in this class.",topology
"Compound CC6 crystallizes directly from the reactionmixture as colourless, plate-like prisms. The material is fullysoluble in chloroform and was characterized by1H and13C NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S4 and S5, Supportinginformation w). Mass spectrometry showed [ CC6 +H ]+and[CC6 + Na]+ions at m/z= 979.49 and 1001.48, consistentwith a [2+3] cage structure composed of two units of 1andthree units of 2with formula C 69H66N6. In previous work,13we showed the cycloimination reaction between 1,3,5-triformyl-benzene and either ethylenediamine, 1,2-propylenediamine, or1,2-cyclohexanediamine led to the formation of [4+6] cagestructures. Here, a [2+3] cage structure was observedinstead. We ascribe this to both the greater ?exibility of the1,5-pentanediamine and also the larger size of the trialdehyde.",topology
"Even though two 1,3,5-phenylbenzene groups are separatedby pentyl linkers, CC6 has a compact structure with little voidspace inside the ＆cage＊. As such, this [2+3] material di?ersfrom the [4+6] cages, CC1每CC3 , all of which are intrinsicallyporous6and have permanent cavities that can accommodateguests.13,14The distance between the two central phenyl ringsis 3.7 A ?, which is typical for p每pstacking.23The solvatedcrystal structure viewed along the c-axis shows a layered,p-stacked system (Fig. 1b). The distance between two layersin the crystal is approximately 5 A ?.CC6 assembles in the solidstate to generate one-dimensional (1-D) channels along thea-axis resulting from imperfect packing of the propeller-shapedmolecules. These extrinsic6pore channels are relatively narrowand constitute approximately 10% of the volume of thestructure. The MeOH solvent molecules can be identi?ed aselectron density within these voids, but these guests were onlypartially resolved and too disordered to be modelled e?ectively.The data was therefore treat ed by using PLATON/SQUEEZE24which calculates six MeOH molecules per cage molecule. Thep-stacked layers run perpendicular to the 1-D MeOH-?lledchannels. There is no connectivity between the channels andthe (negligible) void volume in the cage. A bulk sample of CC6was also analysed by powder X-ray di?raction (PXRD),con?rming it to be both phase pure and representative of thesingle crystal data in both solvated and desolvated forms.Compared with experimental di?raction data, the simulatedPXRD pattern showed systematic shifts in the peak positionsdue to thermal expansion because the single crystal and PXRDdata were collected at di?erent temperatures (Fig. S6 w). LeBail ?tting of PXRD data for CC6 after gas sorption showed agood agreement with PXRD data calculated from the singlecrystal structure (Fig. S7 w).",topology
"Gas sorption measurements were also carried out closer toambient temperature. The N 2adsorption isotherm at 300 Kand 1.2 bar revealed a low gas uptake (0.08 mmol g/C01). Bycontrast, the CO 2uptake for CC6 was 0.9 mmol g/C01under thesame conditions, signi?cantly greater than that reported forthe [2+3] cage prepared by Zhang et al. (0.1每0.25 mmol g/C01).18This adsorption behaviour suggests that CC6 or analoguesmight be candidates for gas separation applications. The idealselectivity was calculated from these isotherms to be 11 forCO2/N2at 300 K and 1 bar. In addition, the material had anideal selectivity for H 2over N 2of 2.4 at 77 K. The CO 2/N2selectivity for CC6 is low compared with the [2+3] imine cagesreported by Zhang et al. where ideal selectivities in the range36每138 were reported.18,21However, in considering materialsfor applications, absolute gas uptakes must also be considered.",topology
"29,30The single crystal structure recorded at 100 K with solventremoved was used for structural analysis and rationalisation ofthe observed gas selectivity. Unlike cucurbit[6]uril,19whereselectivity of CO 2over CO was rationalised on the basis of thehigh enthalpy of CO 2adsorption, we attri bute the selectivityobserved here to the crystal packing. The Connolly surfaceconstructed using a H 2probe radius of 1.42 A ?shows a 1-Dchannel with a fully connected ＆side pore＊ (Fig. 2a). Using aprobe radius of 1.72 A ?for CO2, a 1-D channel was observed buta narrow restricted neck to this side pore was observed. TheConnolly surface obtained using with a N2probe radius of1.82 A ?also demonstrated a narrow, restricted 1-D channel, butin this case the ＆side pore＊ was not connected to the channel(Fig. 2a). This could rationalize the lower uptake for N2and alsothe relatively high H 2uptake observed at 77 K. This behaviour isqualitatively similar to sorption in a [4+6] cage, CC1b.14In summary, we have demonstrated that a [2+3] imine-basedcage shows selectivity for CO 2over N 2at modest pressures.",topology

A solution of 1,5-pentanediamine (20 mg, 0.192 mmol) in MeOH (20 mL) was added slowly. The reaction was left covered for 3-4 days without stirring. The products were observed to crystallize from solution after a week. The crystals were separated carefully from the sample vial using a spatula and washed with MeOH and air dried to give the solvated of [2+3] cage." | 1,3,5-tri-(4-formylphenyl) benzene | "Tribromobenzene (1 g, 3.18 mmol), 4-formylphenylboronic acid (1.72 g, 11.5 mmol), Pd(OAc)2 (3 mg, 0.013 mmol), and PPh3 (6 mg, 0.026 mmol) were added. After degassing this mixture three times, 1-propanol (20 mL) was added under N2. The solution was left stirring at 50∼C until all of the solids dissolved. Once the clear solution turned to pale yellow (ca. 15 min), a solution of Na2CO3 (2 M, 6 mL) and water (5 mL) were added under N2. The resulting mixture was then heated to reflux for 2 h under N2. The nitrogen sources were removed after reflux and another portion of water (20 mL) was added. The reaction mixture was left under stirring, open to the air for 5 h at room temperature. The mixture was then extracted with chloroform (30 mL) and the organic layers were washed with a 2% solution of NaHCO3 (25 mL). A spoonful of activated charcoal was added into the organic solution and the mixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The suspension was filtered through celite under reduced pressure. Evaporation of the solvent gave the crude product. The pure product was obtained after column chromatography with 70% yield, or recrystallized from THF with 65% yield." | 1,5-pentanediamine | None |

"In recent years, the interest in porous materials from discreteorganic molecules substantially increased because it wasdemonstrated that speci?c surface areas for such systems canreach 3000 m2g/C01.1,2Those compounds can be distinguishedinto extrinsic and intrinsic porous materials.1,3Extrinsicporous materials derive from molecules that do not containany prede?ned pores or voids.",surface area
"2In contrast, intrinsic porous materials contain voids orcavities in the molecular precursor itself, which essentiallycontribute to the porosity of the materials. This portion ofintrinsic porosity diminishes the chances of losing the propertyof porosity or surface area while the crystalline self-assembledarrangement collapses during removal of enclathrated solventmolecules. Therefore, such mol ecules can form porous materialsalso in the amorphous state, as long as the molecular structureis shape-persistent and does not pack e?ciently (frustratedpacking). This has been demonstrated for example for triptycenetris(nickel salphenes), which have a Brunauer每Emmett每Tellersurface area (SABET) of 499 m2g/C01.5Furthermore,cucurbit[7]uril, which is a shape-persistent torus-like molecule,showed in the amorphous state a SABETof 293 m2g/C01.6In thisrespect, materials derived from shape-persistent cage compoundsare superior. The ?rst example in the literature was given byAtwood and co-workers, who re-in vestigated the noria molecule,originally introduced by Nishikubo et al.7They showed that thismolecule forms an amorphous porous material with SA BET=280每350 m2g/C01.8We introduced the synthesis of shape-persistent endo-functionalized [4 + 6] cage compounds 3a每e by the iminecondensation of triptycene triamine 19and salicyldialdehydes2a每e (Scheme 1).10,11Although those materials showed thehighest surface areas (up to SA BET= 2071 m2g/C01) in thecrystalline state,11,12they have reasonable surface areas ofapprox. 700 m2g/C01in the amorphous state too.12Cooper et al. demonstrated that the technique of solventremoval for activation of the material is crucial to the morphologyand as a consequence to the gas-accessible speci?c surface area.13For instance, the so-called CC3has in its ( R)-enantiomeric crystal-line form a SA BETof 624 m2g/C01,14whereas the surface area wassubstantially increased to SA BET= 859 m2g/C01when desolvatedby freeze-drying.13Investigations of the m aterials morphologyrevealed mainly an amorphous character. This was till date thehighest reported speci?c surf ace area of an amorphous porouscompound consisting of one molecular structurally de?ned,discrete organic compound, exclusively.",surface area
"The sorption isotherm (Fig. 4) can be classi?ed as a type-Iform, which is characteristic of microporous materials.17Theadsorbed amount of nitrogen is Vmax= 391 cm3g/C01atP/P0=0.95. The speci?c surface areas are SA BET=9 1 9m2g/C01and1037 m2g/C01if the Langmuir-model is considered. These are, tothe best of our knowledge, the highest surface areas of aporous amorphous material, consisting of discrete organicmolecules exclusively.",surface area

"Low scattering power of the crystal enabled us to locate only three of the highly disordered water molecules belonging to the first  hydrati on sphere of the molecule. These were the water molecules that act as fasteners of the cage c onstruction. The remaining solvent molecules could not be easily located and refined. Therefore, we  have corrected the observed data by using the SQUEEZE routine in PLATON.[2] We ha ve found 2927 electrons in 9080 A3, which means that around 53% of the unit cell is filled with diso rdered solvent molecules.  After that we were able to refine the structure to R values of  R1=0.076 and wR2 (all data)=0.240.

Under self-assemblyconditions, single chain, double-stranded cross-linked coordi-nation polymer and two-dimensional (2D) coordinationpolymeric networks were formed via M-L(Ag+,C u2+, andZn2+) coordinative interactions.

These unique metallomacrocyclic cage units in the2D coordination polymeric networks are capable of hosting di ?erent guest species. For instance, the rhomboidal [ M2(L3)2]( M=Ag+,C u2+) cage units were found to host a benzene or a nitrate anion; a hexahedral [ M3(L3)3]( M=A g+) cage was found to hosta ligand Lor a DMF molecule; the hexahedral [ M4(L3)4]( M=C u2+) cage was found to host four solvent molecules of benzene;and the rectangular [ M3(L3)3]( M=C u2+,Z n2+) cage units, however, were found to host two THF molecules.

 ?1) Materials and Synthetic Methods  Reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification, unless otherwise indicated.  Ether, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, CH2Cl2 and DMF are purified by MBRAUN solvent purification systems.  9-hexadecyl-9H-carbazole,1 9-hexadecyl-3,6-diiodo-9H-carbazole,1 9-butyl-9H-carbazole-3,6-dicarbaldehyde,2 1,3,5-tri(4-formylphenyl)benzene,3 1,3,5-tri(4-aminophenyl)benzene,4 9-hexadecyl-6-iodo-9H-carbazole-3-carbaldehyde,5 and 9-octyl-9H-carbazole-3,6-diamine6 were prepared as previously described in the literature.      All reactions were conducted in oven dried glassware.  Unless otherwise specified, solvents were evaporated using a rotary evaporator after workup.  Unless otherwise specified, the purity of the compounds was ≡ 95 % based on 1H NMR spectral integration.  Flash column chromatography was performed by using a 100-150 times weight excess of flash silica gel 32-63 米m from Dynamic Absorbents Inc.  Fractions were analyzed by TLC using TLC silica gel F254 250 米m precoated-plates from Dynamic Absorbents Inc.  Analytical gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed using a Viscotek GPCmaxTM, a Viscotek Model 3580 Differential Refractive Index (RI) Detector, a Viscotek Model 3210 UV/VIS Detector and a set of two Viscotek Viscogel columns (7.8 ℅ 30 cm, l- MBLMW-3078, and l-MBMMW-3078 columns) with THF as the eluent at 30 ∼C. The analytical GPC was calibrated using monodisperse polystyrene standards.  MALDI Mass spectra were obtained on the Voyager-DE? STR Biospectrometry Workstation using sinapic acid as the matrix.  1H NMR spectra were taken on Bruker 300, Inova 400 and Inova 500 spectrometers.  13C NMR spectra were obtained on Bruker 300 and Inova 400 spectrometers.  gHSQC and gHMBC spectra were taken on Inova 500 spectrometer.  gHSQC and gHMBC for compounds 13 and 14 were acquired in C6D6 at 60∼C. All others were acquired in CDCl3 at room temperature. C6D6 (7.15 ppm), and CHCl3 (7.26 ppm) were used as internal references in 1H NMR, and C6D6 (127.88 ppm) and CHCl3 (77.23 ppm) for 13C NMR. 1H NMR data were reported in order: chemical shift, multiplicity (s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet), number of protons, coupling constants (J, Hz).   2) Experimental Procedures  9-Hexadecyl-6-vinyl-9H-carbazole-3-carbaldehyde (3):  The procedure reported by Butler and Denmark was followed.7 9-Hexadecyl-6-iodo-9H-carbazole-3-carbaldehyde (267 mg, 0.49 mmol), Pd2dba3 (22 mg, 0.024 mmol), TBAF (1.0 mL, 1.0 mmol), D4V (2,4,6,8-tetramethyl-2,4,6,8-tetravinyl-cyclotetrasiloxane , 85 uL, 0.24 mmol) and THF (12.0 mL) were added to the reaction vessel under N2.  The reaction was stirred at 80 ∼C for 4 h.  The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, filtered through a short plug of silica gel with ether, and concentrated.  The product was purified by flash column chromatography (gradient elution 5% EtOAc/hexanes to 10% EtOAc/hexanes) to yield a light yellow solid (165 mg, 76%).  Physical S3

"Synthesis. CC1 and CC2 were synthesized as previouslydescribed24,48and recrystallized from a 2:1 mixture of dichloro-methane and 1,4-dioxane. CC2 is synthesized from the racemicpropane 1,2-diamine.

"24Other porous organic cages were also described recently,prepared both via imine condensation,25?28and by directcarbon ?carbon bond formation.29The rapid development ofthis?eld since 2009 is demonstrated by the increase in surfaceareas attained for organic cage molecules, with surfaces areas ashigh as 2071 m2g?1reported by Mastalerz et al.30The samegroup also prepared a hydrogen-bonded molecular solid with aremarkable surface area of more than 2800 m2g?1.18A distinguishing feature of porous organic molecules15is thatthey can be dissolved in common solvents, allowing processingoptions that are unavailable for insoluble frameworks. Solubilityallows porous organic cages to be combined in a modular way,creating binary31and also ternary porous cocrystals.32Cagemolecules can also be cast into composite membranes33andincorporated into macroporous supports.34Porous organiccages were also shown to act as perfect molecular sieves forcertain C9 aromatic hydrocarbons35and as components insensor devices.36,37The vertex functionality in cage molecules can dictate boththe crystal packing and the topology of the resulting porenetwork. For example, a cyclohexane functionalized imine cage,CC3-R, packs in a window-to-window arrangement to generatea 3-D diamondoid pore network.",surface area
"Both polymorphs show a type I nitrogen sorption isothermwith a sharp, low-pressure step, indicative of a microporoussolid (Figure 3). Desolvated CC2汕is also porous to othergases, such as CH4,C O2, and H2, to a similar level as observedforCC2汐(SI, Figures S1 ?S3); however, CC2汕exhibits asigni?cantly lower uptake of nitrogen than CC2汐, and aconcomitantly lower surface area (330 m2g?1compared with533 m2g?1).CC2汕also exhibits a greater slope in theadsorption branch of the isotherm at higher relative pressuresand more pronounced hysteresis in the desorption isotherm.",surface area
"CC2汕:E?ect of Crystallization Conditions on Micro-porosity. The precise crystallization conditions that are usedto prepare the CC2汕material can also substantially a ?ect theporosity. Samples of CC2汕showed variable gas uptakesbetween batches. In principle, the desolvation method mighta?ect the degree of cracking (Figure 4) and, hence, the totalporosity, but this was ruled out in a parallel synthesis study (SIFigure S4), which showed that the method of desolvation hadno statistically signi ?cant e ?ect on porosity. By contrast, themethod used for crystal growth had a major in ?uence, as shownby comparing slow-crystallized samples of CC2汕with materialsthat were precipitated more rapidly from solution by rotaryevaporation of solvent (Figure 6). The apparent BET surfacearea of the rotary evaporated sample (720 m2g?1) was morethan twice as high as the slowly crystallized sample (330 m2g?1). However, powder di ?raction analysis for these twosamples suggests, super ?cially, rather little di ?erence betweenthe two samples, although close inspection does show broaderpeaks in the PXRD data for the sample produced by rapidcrystallization.",surface area
"Nitrogen sorption isotherms for desolvated samples derivedfrom the CC1 ﹞1,4-dioxane solvate show signi ?cant micro-porosity (Figure 9), whereas previous polymorphs CC1汐24andCC1汕61are nonporous to N 2. The apparent BET surface areaof 333 m2g?1is comparable with CC2汕. Hence, despitechanges in the crystal packing upon desolvation, a connectedpore structure is maintained. This would be expected from thesolvent-accessible surface for an in silico desolvated structure(Figure 10); that is, notallowing for any structural rearrange-ments. Again, the number of nitrogen molecules adsorbed percage at P/P0= 0.1 is 2.7, in fair agreement with the three N2molecules per cage that would correspond to an idealized andfully occupied structure. The desolvated CC1 material is alsoporous to hydrogen (SI, Figure S8).",surface area

"As for CC13 汐, the geminal methyl groups are disordered andre?ne with 50% occupancy in the two possible vertex sites. Onemolecule of 1,4-dioxane sits inside each cage, with another fourmolecules of 1,4-dioxane positioned in each cage window, justas for the CC2汕﹞1,4-dioxane solvate. A type I isotherm with nosteps was observed for desolvated CC13 汕structure, along witha much higher gas uptake at low relative pressures (Figure 12).In our ?rst preparation of CC13 汕,CC13 was dissolved indichloromethane, 1,4-dioxane was added, and then the solventswere removed by simple evaporation from an open vessel in afumehood. This gave an apparent BET surface area of 946 m2g?1, almost double that of the CC13 汐polymorph. The N 2uptake was 13.5 mmol g?1atP/P0= 0.99 (10.5 mmol g?1atP/P0= 0.1; Figure 12, blue points). The low-pressure uptakecorresponds to 10.1 N 2molecules per cage: a dramatic increaseover the ‵3N 2per cage for CC1 andCC2 in the same packingarrangement. A concern, therefore, was that this stemmed fromcrystal defects, as discussed above for CC2汕. Therefore, furthercrystallizations of CC13 were performed using slow, carefullycontrolled solvent evaporation under a nitrogen ?ow.",surface area
"This more careful crystallization procedure gave much moreuniform, octahedral crystals (Figure 13b, c); however, thesemore regular crystals showed a higher level of microporosity(Figure 12, red points). Hence, crystal defects cannot beresponsible here for the extra porosity in CC13 汕. The highlycrystalline sample had an apparent BET surface area of 1173 m2g?1, with an N2uptake of 15.3 mmol g?1atP/P0= 0.99 (11.6mmol g?1atP/P0= 0.1), corresponding to 11.1 N 2per cagemolecule. By comparison, high-crystallinity CC3, which packsisostructurally, has a BET surface area of ‵400 m2g?1;6311 N2molecules per cage cannot be rationalized on the basis of asingle diamondoid pore channel, as observed for CC2汕andCC3.",surface area
"18Interpenetration of pore channels represents a di ?erentstrategy for increasing guest uptakes, and all other porousorganic cages with surface areas of more than 1000 m2g?1haverelied on increasing the size of the cage units themselves.30,31However, increasing the cage size can result in a concomitantdecrease in solubility (e.g., for CC5),31thereby limitingprocessability. By contrast, the disordered, geminal methylgroups in CC13 strongly increase the solubility with respect toits close structural analogues. Indeed, CC13 is highly soluble inchlorinated solvents, and it has a much higher solubility (cf.,CC1,CC2, and CC3) in nonhalogenated solvents, such asmethanol and tetrahydrofuran. The solubility of CC13 wasmeasured by1H NMR by comparison with an internal standardand was found to be around 20 times higher in chloroform thanCC3 (200 mg/mL; cf., 9 mg/mL for CC3). Likewise, thesolubility of CC13 in methanol and in tetrahydrofuran was 5and 17 mg/mL, respectively (SI Table S3), whereas CC3 isbarely soluble at all in those solvents.",surface area

" 1.3. Computational details for defect investigation s  To investigate the effect of different crystal defects, which would lower crystallinity, a unit cell of CC3 -R was edited to incorporate a variety of different potential defects. The surface area was then calculated using Zeo++ with a probe radius of both 1.82 and 1.6 ? and compared to the SCXRD structure of CC3 -R. The case was an NPT MD simulation at 750 K, S19  1 atm for 20 ns (with setup otherwise as described in Section 1.2 above), the final structure from the simulation was then analyzed ; this corresponds to a thermally annealed system . The next case was delet ion of  a single CC3  molecule from the center of the simul ation cell, followed by  geometry optimization of  the cell in Forcite using CSFF (setup otherwise as described Section 1.2 above). In another case, a  translational defect was formed by shifting half of the unit cell (4 cages) by a/8 and then geometry optimi zing the cell. A rotational defect was introduced by rotating a single CC3  molecule by approximately 90∼ and then geometry optimizing  the cell. Finally, we attempted to reduce the crystallinity by geometry optimizing  the cell under an external pressure of 10 GPa , and then geometry optimizing  the resultant structure without the external pressure. Loss of crystallinity through pressure -induced amorphization has previously been observed experimentally for  metal organic frameworks (MOFs).9  2. Computational res ults and discussion  2.1. Calculated surface areas  For these porous molecular  materials, which are particularly flexible  and not interconnected by covalent or coordination bonds , we do not expect calculated surface areas to correspond exactly with experimentally  determined  BET surface areas . Indeed , other computational studies have found that uptakes are overestimated compared to experimental values.10 It is more difficult to consider the CC1  systems , such  as CC1汐 and CC1汕 , which are barely porous to N 2 at 77  K (BET surface area < 30 m2 g-1). Also,  CC1 .dioxane can not be desolvated  without structural rearrangement . Nonetheless, t he results in Table S 4 and Figure S20 show that, for the rest of the systems, the surface area is generally somewhat overest imated compared to experiment when calculated using  the smaller probe radius of 1.6 ? (equivalent to the van der Waals radius of a single N atom), but underestimated with a larger probe radius of 1.82 ? (equivalent to the kinetic radius of N 2). Indeed, for  CC2汕 , CC3 -R, and CC13汐 , the BET surface area is bracketed by the se two calculated values. For CC2汐 , both of the calculated values exceed the BET surface area, but for this system there is an added complication of the unknown contribution of formally inaccessible cage voids, as we discussed previously.11  S20   Figure S20 每 A comparison of experimental surface areas (black circle ) and those calculated with a probe radius of 1.82  ? (red square) and 1.6 ? (smaller pale red square).  In all cases, data refer t o the most crystalline samples obtained using slow crystallization conditions. Note that the CC1.dioxane  points refer to artificially, in silico  desolvated structures: since the structure rearranges on desolvation, the corresponding experimental data point  does not exist.",surface area
"? in silico desolvated; ? disorder left in the structure   By comparison, for CC13汕 , both of the calculated values are lower  than the experimental BET surface area of 1173 m2 g-1, although  the calculated value with the smaller probe radius is, within error, essentially  the same as experiment  (1135 m2 g-1). This would suggest that , in order to rationalize  the porosity for CC13汕 , it is necessary to assume that all of the calculated void space is accessible, despite the fact that , even with the smaller probe radius of 1.6 ?, there is a calculated contribution of unconnected void space of 523 m2 g-1 to the total surface area (46% of total surface area). We investigate in the  following section whether these formally inaccessible voids, which are entirely in the extrinsic void  space, can become interconnected during molecular dynamics simulations , and hence effectively double the porosity. A preliminary investigation of a visualization  of surface area for CC13汕  as the probe size is decreased to 1.53 ? suggests that the first po int at which the occluded extrinsic voids will become interconnected across a unit cell occurs when a small pathway opens up between the extrinsic sites, which would suggest a secondary diamondoid pore network between the occluded sites (see Figure S14  and Movie 3). This secondary network is not joined to the primary diamondoid network running through the cages and would therefore System  BET surface area  (m2 g-1) Surface area calculated with a 1.82 ? probe radius (m2 g-1) Surface area calculated with a 1.6 ? probe radius (m2 g-1) ISA Total  ISA Total  CC1 汐 20 0 172 0 343 CC1 汕 30 0 282 0 635 CC1 .dioxane ? n/a 948 948 1392  1408  CC2 汐? 533 0 730 740 1018  CC2 汕? 320 0 199 405 422 CC3 -R 400 0 286 527 527 CC13 汐? 517 0 398 505 779 CC13 汕?,? 1173  420 762 612 1135  S22  suggest an unusual doubly interpenetrated pore network for this system. Indeed, when we created a randomized  structure without the disorder of dimethyls on the vertices, we start to see pathways begin to open between occluded sites for a probe size of 1.82 ? (see Figure 16b, with the thin cyan lines beginning between occluded sites.) We investigate this pore structure further with MD simulations with gases in section  2.2.",surface area
"Performing a high temperature MD simulation for 20 ns at 750 K lowers the order of the cages slightly, but this only increases the surface area margin ally, by 6%. However, there was one defect that significantly increased the surface  (by ~78%; an increase of 273 m2 g-1), which delet ion of  a single cage molecule from the cell . This is equivalent to 12.5% of the cage sites not being occupied , which we do not expected to be physically likely in a real S24  crystal, but which shows that point vacancies can contribute in principle to enhanced surface area. We also note that such defects would not be observed in PXRD patterns or in SC-XRD structures since they woul d be averaged over a bulk structure. We have not investigated here other macroscopic defects such as grain boundaries and dislocations , since the simulation of this is beyond the scope of this study,  but it is likely that such defects  also contribute to porosity in samples with imperfect crystallinity .",surface area

For metal ?organic frameworks and covalentorganic frameworks, this has been addressed by using strong,directional intermolecular bonding to create families ofisoreticular solids. Here, we show that an organic directingsolvent, 1,4-dioxane, has a dominant e ?ect on the latticeenergy for a series of organic cage molecules. Inclusion ofdioxane directs the crystal packing for these cages away fromtheir lowest-energy polymorphs to form isostructural, 3-dimensional diamondoid pore channels. This is a unique function of thesize, chemical function, and geometry of 1,4-dioxane, and hence, a noncovalent auxiliary interaction assumes the role ofdirectional coordination bonding or covalent bonding in extended crystalline frameworks. For a new cage, CC13 , a dual,interpenetrating pore structure is formed that doubles the gas uptake and the surface area in the resulting dioxane-directedcrystals.",this paper's author

The separations between the O atom of P QO bondand the centroids of the three benzene rings have been shortenedfrom 5.20, 4.20 and 4.02 ? in the trialdehyde precursor to 3.85 ?in cage 1, indicative of the slight increase of tension after formingthe [2+3] cage.

"In summary, cavity segmentation has been achieved byintroducing two polar inner-directed P QO bonds in a chiral[2+3] organic molecular cage, which leads to the selective CO 2capture and CH 4exclusion owing to the size-matching andpolarity e?ects. Binding energy calculations between the guestand host molecules give theoretical support to the importanceof the PQO bond partition as well as the overwhelmingabsorption sites of P QO bonds for CO 2, and hence explainsthe selective adsorption of CO 2. This work is suggested toprovide a practical synthetic strategy to control and function-alize the cavity of POCs, and the successful construction ofcage 1 promotes us to extend functional POCs by using otherbuilding blocks to finely adjust the size and polarity of theresultant cavity. In addition, the current study is believed tothrow some light on the design of new organic porous materialsand possible applications on gas separations.",topology

Firstly, equal amounts of two enantiomeric cages were prepared, respectively. 3,3',5,5'-Tetraformyl-4,4'-biphenyldiol (120 mg, 0.40 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (80 mL) and stirred for dissolution at 110 ∼C. A methanol (40 mL) solution of (1R,2R)/(1S,2S)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane (92 mg, 0.80 mmol) and an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid (8 mL, 0.12 mol/L) were added into the mixture, and the red solution was refluxed overnight. Secondly, two opposite chiral enantiomeric solutions were mixed quickly. The resulting mixture was left for slow evaporation in air at room temperature for about 2~3 days. Finally, red single crystals of NC1 suitable for X-ray diffraction determination were collected in a yield of 200 mg.|3,3',5,5'-Tetraformyl-4,4'-biphenyldiol|None|(1R,2R)/(1S,2S)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane|None|

"Results and discussionTo access new building blocks that might form 1D pore channels, we?rst synthesized a series of tetraaldehyde cage precursors withdifferent linker lengths (Fig. 2a).

"To investigate the porous properties, the nitrogen sorption analysis of pTOC was conducted after desolvation at 120 ∼ C for 10 h under vacuum. For pTOC, the BET surface area and pore volume were found to be 929 m2 g?1 (the Langmuir surface area is 1132 m2 g?1) and 0.612 cm3 g?1, respectively (Figure S7B, Sup-porting Information). Compared with nonporous TOC, the good porous structure of pTOC might have resulted from the poly-meric framework that overcome the window-to-arene stacking of TOC and fixed the pores position to keep the permanent porosity. The BET surface area of pTOC was higher than most of porous cages,[6,7,19] and comparable to some emissive porous organic polymers (POPs)[20] (Table S1, Supporting Information). The pTOC showed a steep nitrogen uptake at low relative pressure, implying the presence of micropores in their networks. Low-pres-sure hysteresis was extending to the lowest attainable pressures, which was associated with the irreversible uptake of gas mole-cules in the pores (or through pore entrances). This phenomenon probably means a swelling of polymer matrix at 77 K by nitrogen (Figure 3A). The pore size distribution calculated using Nonlocal Density Functional Theory (NLDFT) method (Figure 3B) also con-firmed the existence of micropores and mesopores, which might result from the intrinsic porosity and expanded networks of the cage monomers. It was worth noting the presence of micropores with an average size of 5.8 ?, which might have originated from the intrinsic cavity of TOC and was in agreement with the crystal-lographic analysis (Figure S4, Supporting Information).",surface area

In an effortto address this deficiency, we have used a hydrazone-based DCCapproach to produce a triangular prism-shaped cage by condensingcarbonyl dihydrazine11Hand a trialdehyde precursor10A3+in water(Fig. 1). This cage acts as a molecular flask to accommodate suitablypaired donor每acceptor substrates, such as guests containing eitherdihydroxynaphthalene or naphthalene diimide. The intermoleculardonor每acceptor interactions between these two guests are remark-ably enhanced within the cage cavity. It was found that cageformation is highly favored at elevated temperatures due to entropiceffects, while at lower temperatures substantial amounts of polymersor oligomers are also generated as byproducts. The kinetics ofhydrazone formation and disassembly were also found to betemperature dependent.

"The e?ort to obtain the single crystal of C6+for X-ray di?ractionanalysis proved unsuccessful. In order to shed more light on thearchitecture of the cage C6+, we synthesized a bis-hydrazone com-pound, namely, S2+/C12PF 6/C0( F i g .2 a ) ,b yc o n d e n s i n g Hwith cationicmethylpyridinium-4-carboxalde hyde in a [1+2] manner (see Fig. S1and S2 in the ESI ?). This bishydrazone derivative S2+could beconsidered as an analog of three bishydrazone fragmental ＆＆walls＊＊ ofthe cage C6+.

The solid-state structure of S2+demonstrates (Fig. 2a) thatwithin the carbonyl dihydrazone residue, one of the two hydrazonenitrogen atoms undergoes intramolecular hydrogen bonding withthe amide proton that is connected to another hydrazone, whichresults in a bent conformation of S2+. Also thanks to the intra-molecular hydrogen bonding, the moiety of S2+in the solid state hasa close to flat conformation. In the cage framework of C6+,t h i spreorganized conformation might help to suppress the formation ofoligomeric or polymeric byproducts in self-assembly. The distancebetween the two hydrazone nitrogen atoms in S2+is approximately4 . 0?( F i g .2 a ) .T h i sd i s t a n c ei ss ignificantly shorter than thatbetween each two of the three aldehyde functional groups in A3+,i.e., simulation by using PM6 demonstrates that the minimaldistance between the two formyl groups in A3+is estimated to bearound 9 ?

The implication is that the formationof an alternative [2+3] condensation product of C6+,n a m e l y P6+(see Fig. 2b), is energy demanding or might be even impossible.",topology
"A number of factors could contribute to the high yield of cageformation. First, the dynamic nature of the hydrazone bond in C6+at elevated temperatures allows the system to undergo errorchecking, allowing the components to ＆＆search＊＊ for the thermo-dynamic minimum. Compared to the polymeric and oligomericbyproducts, the self-assembled cage C6+contains a minimal [2+3]number of components and therefore, necessarily represents themost entropically favored product.12The entropic driving force forcage formation, compared to its byproducts, is enhanced at highertemperatures, given the fact that DG=DH/C0TDS. This, we believe,accounts for the high yield synthesis of the cage product seen atelevated temperatures. Given that the generation of the cage C6+Fig. 1 Structural formulas of precursors A3+,H,a n dt h ec a g e C6+.

"Upon addition  of guest 2 into the solution of C6+ in D2O, we observed (Figure S21b) that the resonances of the proton m and n in 2 undergo significant  upfield shifts.  This observation  indicates that 2 has been encapsulated by the cage  C6+ in D2O, forming (2)2?C6+ complex. 16Figure S22. Optimized structures of a) A3+ and b), c), d) H in different conformations, which  are obtained from PM6 program. One of the benzaldehyde ※arm※ of A3+ is omitted for simplifying the theoretical calculation.  The calculations were performed using  Gaussian 096. The optimized  geometries  were obtained with the method of PM67 in gas phase. Frequency  calculations were performed at the same level  as optimization to identify  the stationary points as minima  (no imaginary frequencies). All the 3D diagrams were generated with  CYLview.8Even although  mass spectrometry indicates  that A3+ and H undergo condensation in a [2+3] manner, the product could be either C6+ or P6+ (see Fig. 2b in the main text for its formula).  In order to confirm that the self-assembled product of condensing A3+ and H in water is C6+, instead  of P6+, we performed theoretical  calculation by using PM6 program. There are several energy-minimized structures of C6+ (see below for the detailed  calculation results).  Among  these structures, the minimized distance (Figure S22a) between two of the three aldehyde oxygen atoms is determined to be 9 ?. In terms of H, there are three  energy-minimized structures (see Figure S22b,c,d). Among these  three  different conformations, the maximized distance  between two nitrogen  atoms in the terminal  NH 2 groups is 4.9 ?. The implication is that,  the formation  of an alternative [2+3] condensation product of C6+, namely  P6+ (see Fig. 2b in the main  text),  is energy demanding or might be even impossible.171C

"45每54Since palladium-mediated catalysis has been widelyapplied and shown great synthetic power in current organicchemistry,55as a proof-of-principle, we chose to use one of themost popular carbon 每carbon (C 每C) bond formation reactions,the Suzuki 每Miyaura cross-coupling reaction, to evaluate thecatalytic activity of PdNP@ 3a. The coupling reactions werecarried out using phenylboronic acid (1.5 equiv.) and PdNP@ 3a(0.01 equiv.) along with various aryl iodides and aryl bromidesbearing a variety of functional groups. All reactions were per-formed in a mixture of toluene/H2O (10 : 1, v/v) using Na 2CO3(3equiv.) as a base. The catalytic activity of PdNP@ 3awas祈rstinvestigated using phenylboronic acid and aryl iodides at 100/C14Cunder microwave heating (Table 1, entries 1 and 2). The reac-tion progress was monitored viaTLC and the crude reactionmixtures were analyzed by1H NMR spectroscopy. Althoughconversion was good a 徇er 10 每15 minutes of reaction, we foundthat increasing the reaction time to 30 minutes gave almostquantitative yields. To broaden the scope of the PdNP@ 3acatalyst, the same conditions were applied to a series of arylbromide substrates using a temperature of 140/C14C. We obtainedthe desired coupling products in almost quantitative yields inmost entries. The analysis of the crude reaction mixture by1HNMR shows little evidence of impurity formation during thecoupling except in entry 5, which was seen to contain 1 每2%biphenyl by-product.",comprehensive synthesis

"*SSupporting InformationABSTRACT: Porous organic cages have emerged over thelast 10 years as a subclass of functional microporous materials.However, among all of the organic cages reported, largemulticomponent organic cages with 20 components or moreare still rare. Here, we present an [8 + 12] porous organicimine cage, CC20 , which has an apparent surface area up to1752 m2g?1, depending on the crystallization and activationconditions. The cage is solvatomorphic and displays distinctgeometrical cage structures, caused by crystal-packing e ?ects,in its crystal structures. This indicates that larger cages candisplay a certain range of shape ?exibility in the solid state, while remaining shape persistent and porous.",surface area
"In comparison with the [4 + 6] cage synthesized by Petryket al., the larger CC20 must be desolvated more carefullybefore gas sorption. The as-synthesized Pm3 structure is poorlycrystalline after the reaction solvent is removed from the pores,and this phase was found to be nonporous to N2afterdesolvation under vacuum at 90 ‵C(Figure 2 andFigures S8 ?S10). However, careful desolvation of the n-pentane activatedIm3 phase under a ?ow of nitrogen followed by vacuum atambient temperature a ?orded a porous phase ( Figure 2 andFigures S11 and S12 ). In contrast, drying the pentane solvatein air for 2 days results in loss of crystallinity ( Figure S13 ). Thecarefully desolvated sample was found to be porous with anSABETvalue of 829 m2/g. However, after activation and postgas sorption, PXRD patterns indicate that this materialtransforms after the n-pentane is removed from the crystalstructure ( Figure S11 ).",surface area
"The as-crystallized P1 CHCl3/MeCN phase was carefullyactivated by initially exchanging the crystallization solvent withn-pentane and then by heating this P1n-pentane solvate at 30‵C under vacuum. After activation using these conditions, wefound that this phase performed better in terms of structuralstability and it remained crystalline after gas-sorption analysis,according to PXRD measurements ( Figure S14 ). Thermogra-vimetric analysis (TGA) also indicates that the CC20 material,crystallized and activated using the same conditions, is stableand crystalline up to 300 ‵C, when it is heated under N2Figure 1.

Growth Des. 2019, 19, 3647 ?36513649(Figures S15 and S16 ). The SA BETvalue for this phase was1752 m2/g, which is one of the higher values reported so far forPOCs ( Figure 2 andFigure S17 ); the current record is 3758m2/g,7but the vast majority of POCs have SABETvalues <1000m2/g.6The desolvated P1 phase also shows a large xenonuptake of 3.44 mmol/g at 1 bar and 273 K; by comparison, thesmaller [4 + 6] CC3 has a Xe uptake of 2.69 mmol/g at 1 barand 298 K ( Figures S17 and S18 ), but unlike CC3,CC20 doesnot appear to be saturated at 1 bar Xe pressure.8Di?erences were observed between the simulated PXRDpatterns of the Im n -pentane solvate and the P1 solvates, incomparison to the PXRD patterns recorded after desolvationand gas sorption analysis, indicating that the cage structurestransform further during these processes ( Figures S19 andS20). This is likely due to changes in the shape of CC20 upondesolvation and/or reorientation of the cages in the crystallattice. We ascribe this to the ↗shape ?exibility ∫exhibited byCC20 and the spherical nature of this cage. We have previouslyfound that smaller spherical cages can be highly solvatomor-phic37and di ?cult to desolvate without pronounced structuraltransformations.",surface area
"13↘SUMMARYIn conclusion, by increasing the bond angle between thereactive functionality on one of the starting materials, we havesuccessfully synthesized a new [8 + 12] cage, CC20 , by iminecondensation. CC20 was observed to form several solvato-morphs by SCXRD, which contain a number of distinctlyshaped cages due to crystal-packing e ?ects. To the best of ourknowledge, this is the ?rst time that a ↗shape-persistent ∫POChas displayed ?exibility in the solid state. The formation of thelarge CC20 was found to be more sensitive to the synthesisconditions than its smaller analogue, and the stabilizing e ?ectsof hydroxyl groups were required to form the cage. CC20exhibits a very high SABETvalue of 1752 m2/g, which is amongthe highest reported for an organic molecular solid.↘ASSOCIATED CONTENT*SSupporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge on theACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.cgd.8b01761 .",surface area

"↘RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCC20 was obtained by the self-assembly of 8 molecules of 2-hydroxy-1,3,5-triformylbenzene (HO-TFB) with 12 moleculesofcis-1,3-CHDA. CC20 is similar in composition to therecently reported [4 + 6] cage, synthesized from HO-TFB andhomochiral trans -1,2-CHDA.",topology
"Initial attempts to synthesize a cis-1,3-CHDA-containingcage focused on reacting the diamine with 1,3,5-triformylben-zene (TFB). However, multiple experimental attempts (usingdi?erent solvents, concentrations, and stirring rates)35all gavecomplex product mixtures by1H NMR, alongside an insolublewhite precipitate. It has been reported that the introduction ofa suitably positioned hydroxyl group can aid the formation ofcage product.36With this in mind, we switched from usingTFB to HO-TFB. HO-TFB was recently reported by Petryk etal. to form a [4 + 6] cage by reaction with chiral trans-1,2-CHDA ( Scheme 1 ). On mixing solutions of cis-1,3-CHDAwith HO-TFB in DCM/MeOH, an insoluble yellowprecipitate was formed initially. After the reaction mixturestood for 1 week, crystals began to grow on the walls of the?ask. During optimization of the experimental conditions, itwas found that layering a dilute solution of the cis-1,3-CHDAonto solid HO-TFB, without stirring, avoided the formation ofthe initial insoluble precipitate; a small amount of TFA wasalso observed to catalyze the reaction. After 2 weeks, a yellowcrystalline product formed on the inner wall of the ?ask, thistime without any insoluble coprecipitate.",topology

Thus, these two conformations of thecage are not distinct minima when the molecule is consideredin isolation and their presence is likely due to crystal-packinge?ects in the solid state. This suggests that there is some?exibility in the cage, although computational modelingsupported by experimental porosity measurements alsosuggests that the cage remains shape-persistent upon desolva-tion.",topology
"22,23Previous e ?orts toward thepreparation of new organic cages have tended to focus onthe assembly, via reversible reactions, of one24or two distinctstarting materials into cages that comprise fewer than 20subunits. The synthesis of larger multicomponent organiccages with high surface areas and large pore volume is rare. Todate, Warmuth,25,26Mastalerz,7,27Gawronski,28Beuerle,29,30and our group31have successfully obtained large organic cagesfrom at least 20 subunits. However, with the exception ofMastalerz ＊s [8 + 12] boronic ester cages,7,27none of these largecages exhibits permanent porosity in the solid state. This couldbe due to collapse of the desolvated cages as a cumulativee?ect of limited rotation in multiple ※rigid §bonds.",topology
"1H and13C NMR,di?usion NMR, and high-resolution mass spectrometry wereconsistent with the formation of an [8 + 12] cage ( Figures S1 ?S5). The successful outcome of this reaction suggests that thehydroxyl group on the aromatic ring is required to stabilize thegeometrical structure of the [8 + 12] cage intermediates byforming salicylic imines with intramolecular hydrogenbonding牯in the absence of hydroxyl groups, this [8 + 12]cage did not form.",topology
"Four solvated single-crystal structures of CC20 wereidenti ?ed. Directly from the synthesis in CH2Cl2and MeOHwe obtained large solvated crystals ( Figure S7 ) with cubic Pm3symmetry. In the Pm3 structure, there are two crystallo-graphically distinct CC20 conformers ( Figure 1 a,b). Whileboth CC20 conformers have open cuboctahedral shapes,comparable to the shape of the [8 + 12] cage reported byGawronski,28one of the cage conformers has an ellipticalshape, which elongates the cage windows ( Figure 1 a).CC20does not have bulky tert-butyl substituents on the vertices likethe Gawronski cage. In the CC20 Pm3 structure, the cages arepacked ine ?ciently window to window, resulting in theformation of large interconnected extrinsic voids ( Figure 1 c).",topology

As indicated in Fig. 2b, the Ag NPs in Ag@1were highly dispersed with an average particle size of ca.2n m(over 400 Ag NPs counted). For determining the Ag NP location,the dynamic light scattering analysis (DLS) was performed on 1,Ag(I)@1 andAg@1 in their mother liquors (Fig. 2c). The particlesize of 1based on DLS was 2.18 nm which was well consistentwith its single-crystal analysis. More importantly, it indicatedthat 1in solution was stable and monodispersed. After the Ag( I)loading and reduction, the measured particle diameters ofAg(I)@1 and Ag@1 were centred at 2.21 and 2.33 nm respec-tively, which were comparable to those of 1and Ag NPs. Thisobservation suggested that most of the Ag( I)@1 and Ag@1existed as the monomer in solution under the given conditions.Thus, the loaded Ag NPs should be basically encapsulatedinside the cage of 1.",surface area

"Guest recognition enhanced by lateralinteractions ?Tianyu Jiao,abKang Cai,bZhichang Liu,cGuangcheng Wu,aLibo Shen,aChuyang Cheng,bYuanning Feng,bCharlotte L. Stern,bJ. Fraser Stoddart *bdeand Hao Li *aA hexacationic triangular covalent organic cage, AzaEx2Cage6+, has been synthesized by means ofa tetrabutylammonium iodide-catalyzed S N2 reaction. The prismatic cage is composed of two triangular2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine ( TPT) platforms bridged face-to-face by three 4,40-bipyridinium ( BIPY2+)spacers. The rigidity of these building blocks leads to a shape-persistent cage cavity with an inter-platformdistance of approximately 11.0 ?A. This distance allows the cage to accommodate two aromatic guests,each of which is able to undergo p每pinteractions with one of the two TPT platform simultaneously, in anA每D每D每A manner. In the previously reported prism-shaped cage, the spacers (pillars) are often consideredpassive or non-interactive. In the current system, the three BIPY2+spacers are observed to play animportant role in guest recognition. Firstly, the BIPY2+spacers are able to interact with the carbonyl groupin a pyrene-1-carbaldehyde ( PCA) guest, by introducing lateral dipole 每cation or dipole 每dipole interactions.",this paper's author

Dichloromethane was freshly distilled from CaH2. The other commercial chemicals were used without any further treatment. The precursors including 4,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]-thiadiazole (TBTD) and 5,5'-(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4,7-diyl)diisophthalaldehyde (BTDP) were prepared according to the published procedures.[1]   Scheme S1. Schematic synthesis and molecular structure of MTC1.  Synthesis of 4,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (TBTD). To a degassed mixture of 4,7-dibromo benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (0.50 g, 1.70 mmol), bis(pinacolato)-diboron (1.30 g, 5.10 mmol), potassium acetate (2.70 g, 27.20 mmol), and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME, 40.0 mL) in a 100 mL three-necked flask, PdCl2(dppf) (62.2 mg) was added. The resultant mixture was heated to 100∼C with stirring under nitrogen atmosphere for 14.0 hours. The reaction was cooled to room temperature and filtered under reduced pressure. The filtrate was concentrated under vacuum, and the solid was successively chromotographed on a silica gel column with hexane and hexane/CH2Cl2 (v/v = 4/1) as the eluent, respectively. The pure product was obtained as the pale yellow solid in the yield of 80% (533 mg). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): 汛 8.13 (s, 2H), 1.44 (s, 24H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 100 MHz): 汛 157.15, 137.88, 84.59, 25.06.  Preparation of 5,5'-(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4,7-diyl)diisophthalaldehyde (BTDP). To a degassed mixture of TBTD (0.20 g, 0.52 mmol), 5-bromoisophthalaldehyde (0.28 g, 1.30 mmol), K2CO3 (0.43 g, 3.12 mmol), 1,4-dioxane (10.0 mL), and H2O (10.0 mL) in a 100 mL three-neck flask, Pd(PPh3)4 (30.0 mg) was added. The resultant mixture was heated to 100∼C with stirring under nitrogen atmosphere for 14.0 hours. The reaction was cooled to room temperature and poured into 100.0 mL water. The residue was washed with excessive amount of water, CH3OH, toluene, and CHCl3 for several times. Because BTDP is insoluble in common organic solvents (such as DMSO, DMF, CH2Cl2, CHCl3, and CH3OH), it is hard to separated using column chromatography and to get its NMR spectrum. As a consequence, BTDP obtained was directly used in the next experiment.  Preparation of MTC1: To a suspension of BTDP (40.0 mg, 0.10 mmol) in dry dichloromethane (20.0 mL), a solution of chiral (R,R)-cyclohexanediamine (22.8 mg, 0.20 mmol) in dry dichloromethane (10.0 mL) was added slowly. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 5 days. Then the reaction mixture was filtered, and organic phase was evaporated under reduced pressure. The yellow product was obtained by the recrystallization of crude product in dichloromethane and methanol, in a yield of 72% (40.0 mg). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): 汛 8.43 (s, 6H), 8.30 (s, 12H), 7.99 (s, 6H), 7.77 (s, 6H), 7.40 (s, 6H), 3.51-3.40 (m, 12H), 1.89-1.53 (m, 48H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 100 MHz): 汛 160.24, 159.59, 153.79, 137.70, 137.35, 136.99, 133.66, 132.32, 129.03, 128.18, 127.53, 75.88, 75.13, 58.63, 51.03, 33.64, 33.05, 24.78, 24.63. MALDI-TOF MS: an isotopic cluster peaking at m/z 1670.16, Calcd. for C102H96N18S3, [M]+ 1670.17. Elemental analysis calculated (%) for C102H96N18S3: C, 73.35; H, 5.79; N, 15.09. found: C, 73.39; H, 5.84; N, 15.12. The single crystals of MTC1 were obtained by the slow of diffusion CH3OH into CH2Cl2 solution containing MTC1.  Preparation of Pd@MTC1-x/y. To a CHCl3 (3.0 mL) solution of MTC1 (10.0 mg, 6.00 米mol), a CHCl3 solution (12.0, 30.0, 60.0, 120.0, 180.0, 360.0, 600.0, and 800.0 米L) containing Pd(OAc)2 in the concentration of 0.10 mol L?1 was added, namely 1/5, 1/2, 1/1, 1/0.5, 1/0.33, 1/0.17, 1/0.1, and 1/0.033 equivalent of MTC1, respectively. After stirring for overnight at 25∼C, a methanol solution of NaBH4 (6.0 equivalents of Pd(OAc)2) was added dropwise into the reaction mixture at 25∼C. After stirring for 3.0 hours, this reaction solution was concentrated under reduced vacuum to about 0.5 mL. Then ethanol was added to precipitate the Pd@MTC1-x/y (x and y was denoted as the mole number of Pd2+ and MTC1, respectively), the solution was centrifuged and washed with ethanol (8.0 mL ∩ 3). A series of Pd@MTC1-x/y composites, including Pd@MTC1-1/5, Pd@MTC1-1/2, Pd@MTC1-1/1, Pd@MTC1-1/0.5, Pd@MTC1-1/0.33, Pd@MTC1-1/0.17, Pd@MTC1-1/0.1, and Pd@MTC1-1/0.033 was dried at 25∼C under vacuum for overnight. The content of Pd for these samples was determined by ICP as 0.7, 1.1, 2.0, 8.5, 11.0, 16.0, 21.6, and 28.6wt%, respectively.",comprehensive synthesis

In the recycle test, after each cycle, the catalyst was separated by centrifugation and washed by CH3OH (three times), and dried at 25∼C under vacuum overnight before next use.  A Job plot. A Job plot was constructed to determine the binding stoichiometry between MTC1 and Pd2+ by monitoring the change in fluorescence intensity (竹em = 494 nm) as a function of the mole fraction of MTC1. Stock solutions (1.0 ℅ 10-3 mol L?1) of MTC1 and Pd2+ were prepared in DMF, respectively. Samples were prepared with different mole fractions of MTC1 and Pd2+ while maintaining the total concentration of ([MTC1] + [Pd2+]) for each test sample solution at 10.0 米mol L?1.  Characterizations. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DPX 400 spectrometer (1H NMR: 400 MHz, 13C NMR: 100 MHz) in CDCl3 and CD3OD. 1H NMR spectra were referenced internally using the residual solvent resonances (汛 = 7.26 ppm for CDCl3 and 汛 = 3.31 ppm for CD3OD) relative to SiMe4. 13C NMR spectrum was referenced internally by using the solvent resonance (汛 = 77.16 ppm for CDCl3 and 汛 = 49.00 ppm for CD3OD). Electronic absorption spectra were recorded on a Lambda 750 spectrophotometer. Steady-state fluorescence spectroscopic studies were performed on an F4500 (Hitachi) spectrophotometer with a PMT voltage of 700 V and a scan speed of 1200 nm/min, the slit width for both excitation and emission was 5 nm. Time-resolved fluorescence lifetime experiments were performed by the time-correlated single-photon-counting (TCSPC) technique. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were taken on a Bruker BIFLEX III ultra-high resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer with 汐-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix. Elemental analysis was performed on an Elementar Vavio El III elemental analyzer. The morphologies of metal nanoparticles and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images were studied using a transmission electron microscopy (JEM-2100F) at an operation voltage of 200 kV. The samples were prepared by placing a drop of product in ethanol onto a continuous carbon-coated copper TEM grid and allowed to dry before the measurements. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were collected with a TTR III multi-function X-ray diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 300 mA with Cu K汐 radiation. The nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms were measured at 77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 PLUS HD88 system with the samples degassed at room temperature for 24.0 hours before the measurement. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were conducted on an ESCALAB 250Xi system. Al K汐 X-ray (6 mA, 12 KV) was utilized as the irradiation source. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Perkin-Elmer instrument over the temperature range of 25 to 800∼C under nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 5∼C/min. ESR measurements were performed at room temperature on Bruker Elexsys E580 X-band. The Pd content of samples was determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis with an Agilent 7700X ICP-MS instrument.  Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were carried out using CHI 760E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua Instrument, Shanghai, China) in a three-electrode electrochemical cell. The experiments were conducted in anhydrous dichloromethane with tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 mol L?1) as supporting electrolyte. The working electrode was a glassy carbon electrode. The counter electrode was an Ag wire. The reference electrode was based on the Ag/Ag+ electrode, which was connected to the solution by a Luggin capillary whose tip was placed close to the working electrode. It was corrected for junction potentials by being referenced to the ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) couple. Typically, the sample solution was purged with nitrogen for 20 min, and then the voltammograms were recorded at ambient temperature. The scan rate was 0.1 V s?1 for the CV measurement.  Single crystal crystallography. Crystallographical data of organic cage was collected on a diffractometer of SuperNova, Dual, Cu at home/near, AtlasS2 with Cu K汐 radiation (竹 = 1.54184 ?) at 200.00 K. The structure was solved by the direct method (SHELXS-2014) and refined by full-matrix least-squares (SHELXL-2014) on F2.[2] Anisotropic thermal parameters were used for the non-hydrogen atoms and isotropic parameters for the hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen atoms were added geometrically and refined using a riding model. Crystallographic and refinement parameters for organic cage are compiled in Table S1 (Supporting Information). Because there are seriously disordered solvent molecules in the cage pores, ＆SQUEEZE＊ command was employed. CCDC 1935950 for MTC1 contains the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper. These data can be obtained free of charge from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif.  Theoretical simulations. MTC1 was firstly optimized at the B3LYP/3-21G* level of theory to provide a scanned energy profiles about the rotations of BTD unit, and finally refined at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. All calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 software package.[3]   For the purpose of investigating potential coordination sites of MTC1 towards divalent palladium ions, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out on the basis of B97XD/BSI, using Gaussian 09 D.01 software package.[4,5] The BSI denotes a mixed basis set, which SDDALL for Pd and 6-311G(D) for nonmetal atoms.[6,7] The most preferred coordination structure of MTC1 toward divalent palladium ion was optimized, Figure S17 (Supporting Information), showing the complexation of Pd ion using one imine nitrogen atom and one BTD nitrogen atom and two acetate anions. The binding energy is -28.62 kcal mol?1. For a comparative study, the coordination site between Pd2+ ion and CC3 was calculated as well, and the binding energy is -19.29 kcal mol?1. The larger absolute value for the binding energy of Pd2+ ion with MTC1 than that of CC3 indicates the stronger complexation for the former cage.

"5﹜Section S2 : Synthesis and characterization  Synthesis of TpOMe -CDA  (?) : At first 1,3,5 trimethoxy benzene (TpOMe, 2 mmol, 504 mg) was taken in  a round bottom flask and then 20 ml of ethyl acetate was added into it. The solution was placed in an ice bath followed by slow addition (~1ml/5min) of (1R, 2R) 1,2 -diamino cyclohexane (CDA, 3 mmol, 342 mg) solubilised in 20 ml of DCM. During the addition temperature should be maintained at near to 00 C. A catalytic amount (~5 ?L) of TFA was ad ded after the complete addition. After that , reaction mixture was allowed to keep undisturbed at 20  0C under the condition of slow evaporation. After 48 hrs blocked shaped S4  crystals were appeared at the bottom of the round bottom flask which was collected, washed with ethanol  (Yield 708 mg, 96%) . The yield of the TpOMe -CDA  crystals largely depends on the choice of the solvent and the reaction conditions. This can be rationalized by the variable solubility and the reactivity of the starting materials in diffe rent solvents. If the temperature is not maintained close to 0 ? C, during the addition, reaction occurs at a faster rate and the yield reduces. In the absence of TFA, the reaction takes longer time for its completion and is also associated with lower yield. Instead of DCM: EtOAc (1:1) mixtures if only DCM is used then  also yield of the TpOMe -CDA  crystals reduce  significantly. These crystals were not shape persistent and after a few minutes of keeping at ambient atmosphere it got cracked which were found to be not suitable for diffraction. Finally good quality single crystals suitable for diffraction were obtained after recrystallising in (1:1) mixture of chloroform and acetonitrile . 1H NMR (CDCl 3): ? 8.53 (s, 12H), 3.54 (s, 36H), 3.41  (s, 12H) , 1.48-1.82 (m, 48 H) ppm.  13C NMR  (CDCl 3): ? 162, 153, 120, 62, 33, 24 ppm.  Mass of TpOMe -CDA  (C84N12O12H108) was confirmed by MALDI/TOF ([M+H]+ 1477.8288 and observed 1477.9869).

We could prepare pure single crystals of TpOMe-CD A in bulk (ca. 5 g) by adding a dichloromethane (DCM) solution of CDA (dropwise) to the TpOMe solution in ethyl acetate (EtOAc) in the presence of a catalytic amount of TFA. Instead of DCM:EtOAc (1:1) mixtures, if only DCM is used the yield of the TpOMe-CDA crystals reduced significantly." | TpOMe | "1,3,5-trimethoxy benzene" | CDA | "(1R, 2R) 1,2-diamino cyclohexane (CDA, 3 mmol, 342 mg), solubilised in 20 ml of DCM" |

"Guest protection within cage cavityWithin the cavity of 36+, the guests are isolated from the bulk envi -ronment, which prevents them from reacting with other substrates in the bulk solutions (Fig.?3A). For example, combining an electron-  deficient alkyne 4 (69 mg) and anthracene (0.43 mg) in MeCN (0.6?ml) led to the formation of a Diels-Alder adduct 5, after heating the solution at 80∼C for 74 hours. The pseudo每first-order rate constant kobs was determined to be 0.024?s?1 (Fig.?3B, black plot) by using 1H NMR spectroscopy. As a comparison, after encapsulating within the cavity of the cage 36+, the rate of Diels-Alder reaction was signifi -cantly decreased. kobs was measured to be 0.0029?s?1 (Fig.?3B, red plot), nearly one order of magnitude smaller than that in the absence of the host.

"Dynamic gas breakthrough measurement experiments  In typical breakthrough experiments, ~ 0.56 g of pre -activated NKPOC -1-汐 was placed in quartz tubing (8 mm diameter) to form fixed bed. First, the adsorbent bed was purged under a 30 cm3 min-1 flow of He gas at 60 ?C for 60 min prior to breakthrough experiment. Upon cooling to room temperature, the gas flow was switched to the  desired gas mixtures at a particular flow rate (the respective flow rates are mentioned in the main manuscript). Herein, binary (2:1 C 3H4/C3H6 and C 3H4/C3H8) and ternary (2:1:1 C 3H4/C3H6/C3H8) C3-hydrocarbon mixtures were performed for breakthrough experi ments at 25 ?C and 1 bar. The outlet composition was continuously monitored by a gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC2030 with a FID detector)  until complete breakthrough was achieved. After each breakthrough experiment, the packed column bed was regenerated at 120 oC with constant He flow (30 cm3 min-1) for ~120 min to ensure complete sample regeneration.  The total gas flow rate s of C3H4/C3H6, C3H4/C3H8 and C 3H4/C3H6/C3H8 are 0 .95, 1.1 and 1.0 mL/min, respectively .

The structures were solved by the direct method and refined by the full -matrix least -squares method on F2 with anisotropic thermal parameters for all non -hydrogen atoms.  We used the ＆squeeze＊ of PLATON  to remove the disordered solvent molecules of NKPOC -1-汕, the SQUEEZE command was not performed for NKPOC -1-汐. Crystallographic data and structure refinement data are shown in Table S 3.

"coordinate covalent bonds, and the latter utilize weaker forcessuch as hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions30,31Molecular crystals might therefore be expected to undergo thephase transformations required of SPCs with lower activationenergies and less strain than ?exible MOFs.1Such molecularcrystals provide a distinct strategy for creating a newgeneration of guest-responsive materials.32Porous organic cages (POCs)33?37are a relatively recentlyintroduced type of molecular crystal and are ideal candidates toserve as SPCs1,38because they can exhibit both intrinsicporosity and extrinsic porosity. Moreover, POCs possessdistinctly di ?erent features from network materials (e.g.,MOFs, zeolites) especially solubility in common solvents.They can also o ?er high chemical stability, low density, andgood processability, allowing for ease of handling, recrystalliza-tion, and thin ?lm fabrication. However, although POCs havebeen developed for over a decade,39?45their use in preparingSPCs that exhibit stimuli-r esponsive dynamic sorptionbehavior and reversible structural transformations is underex-plored. We report herein the synthesis of [2 + 3] imide-basedorganic cage NKPOC-1 (NKPOC = Nankai porous organiccage), which exhibits both intrinsic and extrinsic porosity inthe solid state ( Scheme 1 ). Speci ?cally, upon exposure tovarious gas molecules, activated NKPOC-1 crystals reversiblyswitch from a ※closed §nonporous phase ( 汐) to two types ofporous ※open §phases ( 汕and污). We address the relevance ofthese phenomena to gas separations and use moleculardynamics (MD) calculations and in situ adsorption/PXRDexperiments to study the mechanism of the gate-openingsorption behavior of NKPOC-1 .",topology
"←RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSynthesis and Characterization of NKPOC-1. NKPOC-1was prepared via a one-step condensation reaction of a?exible triamine and a rigid dianhydride in acetic acid ( Figure1a). The1H NMR spectrum ( Figure S1 ) has three signals at8.07, 7.47, and 6.35 ppm, which can be assigned to hydrogenatoms on aromatic rings, indicative of the symmetric structureofNKPOC-1 . Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) has a signal at m/z= 1067.2991 corresponding to theexpected [2 + 3] product [C60H42N8O12]H+.",topology

"Conventionally, symmetric tritopic monomers such as1,3,5-triformylbenzene ( i) have been commonly used toconstruct cages. By using these highly symmetric buildingblocks as vertices along with liner ditopic linkers, classic cages(such as T-symmetric [4+6] cage, OMC1 ) with one type ofsymmetric windows (W1) can be achieved (Figure 1).[2c]When the symmetry of the vertex is reduced, cage moleculeswith lower symmetries and more than one type of windowscan be obtained. For example, a tetra-aldehyde ( ii) with D2hvertex and the diamine linker ( iv) can be assembled into a D3hsymmetric trigonal prismatic cage OMC2 with two types ofsymmetric windows (W1 and W2): triangular and rectangularwindows.",topology

"The structure of the OMC3 was characterized by Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nuclear magneticresonance spectroscopy (NMR), and MALDI-TOF massspectrometry. FTIR analysis shows the conversion of alde-hyde and amine groups to imines (Supporting Information,Figure S2). The peaks at 1682 and 3342 cm/C01corresponding tothe stretching vibration of C =O and N /C0H are absent in the IRspectrum of the product. The new stretch peak at 1629 cm/C01appeared, confirming the formation of C =N bond. The NMRspectrum also indicates that the product does not containstarting amines and aldehydes (Supporting Information,Figures S3每S6). Although there are two types of chemicallyinequivalent imine protons, and aryl protons, the1H NMRspectrum obtained at 298 K shows four singlets at 7.94, 7.54,7.47 and 6.98 ppm in a 1:1:1:1 ratio for the aryl protons andfour singlets at 8.70, 8.60, 8.31 and 8.13 for the imine protons(Supporting Information, Figure S5). Such magnetic inequi-valence of the chemically equivalent protons suggests the highrigidity and low symmetry of the cage product. Althoughsome line broadening was observed in the1H NMR spectrumobtained at a lower temperature (273 K), the eight distinctsignals of the imine and aryl protons are still present at thesame peak positions, indicating minimal structural change andthe rigidity the cage molecule (Supporting Information,Figure S8). The nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectros-copy (NOESY) spectrum of the cage shows correlationsbetween spatially close protons, such as the hydroxyl protonsand imine protons, the imine protons and benzene ringprotons, and the imine protons and cyclohexane ring protons(Supporting Information, Figure S9). Owing to the rigidity ofthe cage, NOE effect was not observed between the arylprotons, which is consistent with the crystal structure.Diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) revealed the diffu-sion coefficients of the cage is 4.38 /C60.35 /C148 10/C010m2s/C01,corresponding to the effective hydrodynamic radius Rof9.3/C60.7 /C138 based on the Stokes-Einstein equation (Support-ing Information, Figure S10). This is in line with the observedcage dimensions in the crystal structure (Figure 2). TheMALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of the productshows the mass-to-charge ratio ( m/z) of 1987, matching withthe [[4+8]OMC3 +H]+(Supporting Information, Fig-ure S11).",topology

"To gain theoretical insights, the formation of the otherpossible cages, [2+4] cage (OMC4), [3 +6] cages (OMC5 andOMC6) were analyzed through density functional theory(DFT) calculation and compared to the formation of OMC3(Supporting Information, Figure S27). After the optimizationof molecular geometries, the entropy of symmetry ( Ssys) of the[4+8] cage ( OMC3 ) was 4.44 kJmol/C01less than that of themost common [3 +6] cage (OMC5), indicating that the [3 +6]cage (OMC5) is symmetry-entropically more favored than theOMC3 (Supporting Information, Table S4). However, ther-modynamic analysis of the conversion of OMC3 to othercages shows that although the formation of [4+8] cage(OMC3 ) is entropically less favored, it is more favoredenthalpically showing positive standard reaction enthalpy(DrHA) energy and positive standard reaction Gibbs energy(DrGA) (Table 1). We also monitored the reaction progress byanalyzing the solution phase using NMR spectroscopy(Supporting Information, Figure S7). We found all the start-ing materials were consumed within the first 5 minutes andthe cage product was gradually increased over the course of24 h. After 48 h, the ratio of OMC3 in the solution phase wasdecreased presumably because the precipitation of OMC3overrides its formation under a very low concentration.",topology

Abstract: Self-assembly via imine condensation in aqueous media has been considered as a formidable task, due to the labile nature of imine in the presence of water. Here, by taking advantage of multivalence and ligand preorganization, a set of basket-shaped triscationic cage molecules are self-assembled in high yields as the predominant products in both water and organic solvent, by condensing a hexaformyl and bisamine. These cage products especially the chiral ones are rather stable or inert in aqueous solution, i.e., no remarkable decomposition was observed upon performing dilution, precipitation, or exposed to competitive amines or aldehydes. Such water-compatible nature allows the hosts to take advantage of hydrophobic effect to accommodate a variety of hydrophobic guests. The chiral cage S-23+ is capable of selectively binding and distinguishing one of the two enantiomers, opening up opportunities for applications such as chiral compound separation. Chiral narcissistic self-sorting and sergeants-and-soldiers effect are observed in the cage formation, when two amino precursors are involved in self-assembly.  Introduction One of the unique properties of host molecules, often in the form of macrocycles and cages, is their ability to use their intrinsic pockets to accommodate guests. Within the host cavities, the guests experience different chemical environments from the bulk solution. As a consequence, their properties are altered, enabling various tasks to be accomplished, such as separation of guests[1] with similar physical properties, stabilization of labile reaction intermediates[2] or energy demanding guest conformers,[3] as well as catalysis.[4] Synthesis of host molecules, especially those with complex three-dimensional architectures, often requires simultaneous formation of multiple covalent bonds. In order to avoid or suppress oligomeric and polymeric byproducts, dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC)[5] based on reversible reactions has been developed, including imine condensation.[6] One of the merits of using DCC is that, the reversible nature of dynamic bond allows the occurrence of error checking, as a consequence of which, a target molecule could be obtained in high or quantitative yield if it represents the most thermodynamically favored product.  However, one of the major disadvantages of using imine for self-assembly is that, imine is generally considered incompatible with water, a solvent leads to imine hydrolysis. The consequence is that, self-assembly via imine condensation is often or always performed in organic solvent in spite of a handful of exceptions.[7] These solvent molecules often occupy the cavities of hosts as competitive guests, jeopardizing their ability to accommodate other guests. In addition, the opportunities of using these molecules containing imine bonds in biological systems which choose water as the life medium are also ruined. Attempts to stabilize imine have been made successfully by either metal-coordination,[8] or replacing imine with more robust N-substituted derivatives such as hydrazone and oxime.[9] Using typical imine to self-assemble purely covalent host molecules in water is still a formidable task. Kim[6j] obtained a set of cubic cages, which were observed to be rather robust in organic每water media. Warmuth[7a,7b] and Cougnon[7c] independently self-assembled cryptophanes and catenanes in pure water via imine condensation. These successes rely on either hydrophobic guest templates or self-template in catenation. However, the shortcomings resulting from the labile nature of imine are still not addressed, limiting the practical applications of these systems. That is, these cryptophanes and catenanes are likely to undergo degradation upon removal of guest templates, switching the solvent, or changing the concentration. New approaches that lead to robust molecules in water still need to be exploited.  More recently, it has been observed[10] that multivalence could help to solidify the self-assembled molecular entities. That is, even though each of the dynamic bonds including imine is rather labile and apt to hydrolyze, the self-assembled molecules might become rather kinetically inert, when each of the building blocks is connected with each other via multiple linkages. Simultaneous cleavage of multiple bonds is obviously much more difficult than breaking a single dynamic bond. For example, a tetrahedron cage[10a] was self-assembled by condensing a trisamine and a trisformyl in CDCl3. The yield is close to quantitative on account of dynamic nature of imine. No ligand scrambling was observed when the cage was boiled with a competitive trisformyl ligands for no less than two days. We thus envision that by taking advantage of multivalence, cages could become robust in water without relying on guest templates. Such hypothesis was proven by a series of proof-of-concept experiments. That is, a set of basket-shaped cages were self-assembled by condensing a 1:3 mixture of hexaformyl compound and trans-diaminocyclohexane (CHDA) in both water and MeCN as the predominant product, in the yield of 60% and 92%, respectively.  When a more flexible bisamine, namely ethylenediamine (EDA), was used in self-assembly, cage self-assembly was less successful in water, i.e., substantial amount of polymeric byproducts were also observed.

Performing counterion exchange yielded a water-soluble cage, which was observed to be inert in water. In the case of the chiral cages containing more preorganized building blocks, such kinetic inertness is even more remarkable, i.e., no remarkable degradation via imine metathesis or hydrolysis was observed during counterion exchange, dilution, solvent switching, or exposed to competitive amines or aldehydes. The water-compatibility allows the cages to take advantage of hydrophobic effects to accommodate a variety of guests in water, including chiral ones. 1H NMR titration experiments demonstrated that one of the chiral cages is able to selectively recognize one of two enantiomers. Narcissistic self-sorting was observed when a racemic mixture of trans-CHDA was used in self-assembly, yielding a pair of cage enantiomers each of which contains only one type of CHDA enantiomers. When (S,S)-CHDA and EDA were combined together in self-assembly, a so-called sergeants-and-soldiers effect was observed. That is, cages containing one or more chiral diamino residues provide the same CD signal intensity as the counterpart containing only the chiral bisamino linkers. The commonly-accepted precept that self-assembly based on imine condensation yielding stable products wouldn＊t occur in water, is thus overturned to some extent.  Results and discussion A tricationic hexaaldehyde precursor 13+?3Br岸 was synthesized (see the details in the Supporting Information (SI)), which bears three pyridinium and six formyl residues. The triscationic nature endows its water-solubility. 13+?3Br岸 (6 mM) and (1S,2S)-(-)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane ((S,S)-CHDA) were combined (Figure 1) in a 1:3 ratio in D2O. After heating the solution of the mixture at 80 ∼C for no less than 8 h, 1H NMR spectrum was recorded (Figure S19), indicating that a basket S-23+?3Br岸 was self-assembled as the predominant product. No other byproducts were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum. The resonances of the relatively acidic protonsㄛ namely those in the methylene (marked with a red star in Figure 1) and pyridinium units (marked with a black star in Figure 1) disappeared due to deuteration. The yield of S-23+?3Br岸 was determined to be around 60%, by using an internal standard in the corresponding 1H NMR spectrum (see Figure S67). The self-assembly of S-23+?3PF6岸 was also successful in organic solvent, i.e., combining 13+?3PF6岸 (6 mM) and (S,S)-CHDA (18 mM) in CD3CN produced S-23+?3PF6岸 in almost quantitative yield. Water-soluble solid-state samples of the cage, namely S-23+?3NO3岸, were isolated in 92% yield, by performing counterion exchange to the MeCN solution of S-23+?3PF6岸 (see the SI for the counterion exchange procedure). The structures of S-23+?3PF6岸 and S-23+?3NO3岸 were fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy (Figures S5每S10) and mass spectrometry (Figures S11 and S12). 1H NMR spectrum of S-23+?3NO3岸 recorded in D2O is pseudo identical as that of S-23+?3Br岸 self-assembled directly in D2O, except that in the former case, the resonances of the relatively acidic protons were observed. The resonances of the methylene (marked with a red star in Figure 1) and imine protons (marked with a blue star) both split into two peaks, indicating the chirality of the cage framework of S-23+ (Figure S5). The chirality of S-23+ was also convinced by recording circular dichroism (CD) spectrum (Figure 2, red trace). When (1R,2R)-(-)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane ((R,R)-CHDA) was used, the enantiomer of S-23+, namely R-23+ was self-assembled (Figure 1, left), as inferred by its mirror-like CD spectrum (Figure 2, blue trace) as that of S-23+. Using a racemic mixture of (R,R)-CHDA and (S,S)- Figure 1.

When a racemic mixture of the two amines are used, a racemic mixture of R-23+﹞3Br岸 and S-23+﹞3Br岸 are produced.",this paper's author

"5﹜Results and DiscussionSchiff-base condensation generally has great compatibility with different solvents, and different solvents have large influences on the final molecular crystallization and solid-state crystal packing33,34. Acetonitrile/chloroform (v/v = 5:1) was adopted as a mixed-solvent in the synthesis of previous [2 + 3] phosphate cage just because of its suitability to grow single crystals. Actually, both acetonitrile and chloroform were effective solvents to yield the [2 + 3] cage. However, in the following self-assembly reaction between two tritopic precursors [phosphate trial-dehyde and tris(2-aminoethyl)amine], it is found that the type of reaction solvents could dramatically impact the self-assembled outcomes (Fig.? 1). In our experiments, acetonitrile as a single solvent for equimolar self-assembly is firstly tried since two tritopic precursors with a 1:1 molar ratio could theoretically form a [4 + 4] molecular cage. Nevertheless, the ESI-MS spectrum does not give the expected [4 + 4] assembled results, in which two 1State Key Laboratory of Coordination Chemistry, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, 210093, P .R.

Furthermore, the 1H NMR spectrum of this species evi-dences the existence of the aldehyde group (Fig.?S1). The combination of ESI-MS and 1H NMR analyses suggests that one aldehyde group from every phosphate trialdehyde precursor is not involved in the cage construction Figure 1.

"11﹜Given that gas sorption phenomena have been revealed on discrete organic molecular solids, gas adsorption properties of this [4 + 4] cage were explored. After thermal activation for 12 h at 80 ∼C under the high vacuum, the crystalline sample has lost its crystallinity/solvents and became amorphous (Figs.?S5 and S6). The N2 adsorption isotherms of the cage at 77 K indicate a low BET surface area (less than 10 m2/g), which is similar to other discrete cage compounds38每41. Gas adsorption experiments at 273 and 298 K reveal that the cage has selective adsorption of CO2 over CH4. As illustrated in Fig.? 4, it can absorb 12.46 and 5.71 cm3 g?1 of CO2 at 273 and 298 K and 1.0 bar, whereas small amounts of CH4 uptake can be observed at 1 bar (2.36 and 0.68 cm3 g?1 at 273 and 298 K). The selectivities of CO2 over CH4 estimated from Henry＊s constants are 7.10 and 6.52 at 298 and 273  K (Table?S2), respectively, which are comparable with other previously reported OMCs (For CO2 vs CH4 adsorption and sepa -ration of some selected OMCs, see Table?S3). The reason for the high selectivities of CO2 over CH4 is probably due to the presence of polar functional P=O groups for CO2 adsorption12,42,43.",surface area

Single-crystal structure analysis reveals that the caivity is surrounded by four phosphate uints. Good selectivity of CO2 adsorption over cH4 is demonstrated by the gas adsorption experiment.",topology
"4﹜A semi-flexible phosphate based trialdehyde had been proved to be a practicable precursor containing P= O functional site and a functionalized [2 + 3] imine OMC was successfully obtained by our group32. As a part of our ongoing research on OMCs, we aim to further investigate and demonstrate that the semi-flexible precursor could also satisfy the requirements of different geometrical organic cage assembly. So we have changed the amine component from previous ditopic linker (cyclohexanediamine) to a flexible tritopic linker [tris(2-aminoethyl)amine]. For multi-component systems comprising competitive reactions, increasing the number of reactive end-ing groups and the flexibility of the amine linker is bound to complicate the self-assembly process. To address this challenge, a solvent-controlled method was tried and applied to simplify the self-assembly process towards the desired OMC in this paper.",topology

This half-way self-assembly could be ascribed to the poor solubility for the [2 + 3] cage product in acetonitrile, which tends to precipitate from the reaction solution and terminate the further imine condensation.",topology
"7﹜Considering that chlorohydrocarbon solvents are often used in the cage syntheses11,16,21每23,35,36, a mixture of 1:1 acetonitrile and chloroform is then used for this reaction. Although the formation of partial [2 + 3] cage still occurs, the successful assembly of a [4 + 4] molecular age is achieved which can be verified by the presence of new ESI-MS peaks at m/z = 1006.17, 671.25 and 503.67 with the isotopic distribution patterns separated by 0.50 ㊣ 0.01, 0.33 ㊣  0.01 and 0.25 ㊣ 0.01 Da (Figs.? 2b and S2), corresponding to 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4 of the molecular weight of the [4  + 4] cage. In order to improve the yield of [4  + 4] cage, pure chloroform is explored, where the ESI-MS spectrum clearly exhibits three positive peaks originating from the [4 + 4] cage excluding the peaks of half-way [2  + 3] cage (Fig.? 2c). The formation of [4  + 4] cage was further confirmed by a peak at m/z  = 2012.64 in the MALDI-TOF-MS spectrum (Fig.? 2d). In addition, 1H NMR spectrum provides reliable proofs for the forma-tion of this [4 + 4] cage, where only one set of signals could be observed for this symmetrical structure (Fig.?S3).",topology
8﹜The molecular structure of [4 + 4] cage was further verified by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. Slow evaporation of the reaction solution affords the suitable single crystals for the X-ray diffraction determination.,topology
"9﹜Crystallographic analysis shows that this [4 + 4] cage has a tetrapodal structure with symmetry (Fig.? 3). The shape of the cage could also be regarded as tetrahedral shape with the tertiary amine nitrogens of the amine linkers as four vertexes. In both [4 + 4] cage and previously reported [2 + 3] cage, the phosphate tetrahedron comprised by four oxygen atoms is very rigid (Fig.? 3a). However, three P-O single bonds of the phosphate tetrahedron could be rotated along the axial direction freely, which would result in the three benzene rings pointing toward different orientations during the construction of OMCs with cyclohexanediamine and tris(2-aminoethyl)amine. Herein we use the distance between the O atom of P= O double bond and the centroid of benzene ring to illustrate the discrepancy between the conformation of the cages. This parameter is the same as 3.85 ? for three benzene rings in the previous [2 + 3] cage exhibiting the typical tripod configuration, while it changes to 3.94, 4.10 and 5.13 ? in the current [4 + 4] cage indicating two different orientations in forming a more complicated cage with flexible tris(2-aminoethyl)amine. Unlike the previous [2 + 3] cage, the P= O bonds does not point straight toward the cage centre in this [4 + 4] cage and the window of the cage cavity was partially occupied by the oxygen atoms of the P =O units (Fig.? 3b). In addition, a cavity with a 4.0 ? diameter taking into account the van der Waals radii of the atoms is found in the cage, which is comparable with that of some gas molecules such as CO2, CH4 and N237.",topology
"10﹜In addition, the thermal stability of this [4 + 4] cage is evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), in which the decomposition temperature is high up to 300 ∼C (Fig.?S4). This work is believed to give a representative exam-ple to illustrate the semi-flexible and versatile traits of this phosphate trialdehyde.",topology
"12﹜conclusionIn summary, one novel [4 + 4] phosphate OMC can be efficiently synthesized in a one pot reaction through solvent-controlled multicomponent imine condensation between tris(4-formylphenyl)phosphate and tris(2-aminoethyl)amine. It is concluded that acetonitrile is beneficial to the assembly of [2 + 3] halfway cage, Figure 3.

Structurally, this cage possesses one distinctive cavity constituted by four phosphate units. Furthermore, this [4 + 4] phosphate OMC displays good selectivity of CO2 adsorption over CH4. Thus, the strategy we offered here to synthesize the [4 + 4] phosphate cage is believed to be instructive for designing new type functionalized organic cages and host molecules in supramolecular chemistry.",topology

"[4c]Despite therichness in imine chemistry,[16]these are the only fewexamples where transformations have been exploited topost-stabilize organic cage compounds under the conserva-tion/retention of porosity.[17,18]Here we present our results on transforming a [4 +6]salicylimine cage directly (without the necessity of protectingthe phenolic hydroxy groups) into a quinoline cage bya twelve-fold Povarov reaction[19,20]with subsequent oxidation(Scheme 1). The quinoline cage 2was synthesized by treatingthe imine cage 1[7f]in neat phenylacetylene as the solvent,with scandium triflate (3.6 equiv) as the Lewis acid andchloranil (12 equiv) as the oxidant. After heating at 1008C for20 hours, and after removal of by-products by columnchromatography the cage was isolated in 25% yield. It isworth mentioning that this corresponds to 89% per iminebond, which is even higher than we were able to realize for thebisquinoline model compound 3(here the yield was 35% andper imine bond 59%.

"[4a,11]Nevertheless, with a follow-up reaction, porosity can berecovered. This has been exemplified, for example, forCooper/C29s smaller [4+6] amine cages where the reducedamine cage contains 1,2-diamine units, which form aminalswith aldehydes or ketones.[12]Another similar approach is thefixation of the corresponding amines of [2 +3] salicyl iminecages[13]as carbamates.[14]Recently, our group demonstratedthat the twelve imine bonds of a rigid shape-persistent [4 +6]salicylimine cage can be transformed by Pinnick oxidationsinto chemically much more robust amide bonds with reten-tion of the shape persistency.[15]Indeed, this amide cage wasstable in a slightly broader pH range ( /C01 to 14.5) than, forexample, the carbamate cage ( /C01 to 14).[14]This unprece-dented stability opened the possibility for further chemicalderivatization under harsh reaction conditions, such asselective twelve-fold bromination or nitration, occurring inyields greater than 80%. Unfortunately, the Pinnick reactiondoes not work in the presence of the phenolic hydroxy group,so that the six hydroxy groups of the salicylimine cage neededto be first transformed into methyl ethers.",topology

"The chemical and thermal stability of the compound wastested. A sample was heated to 350 8C and showed, aftercooling to room temperature, no difference in the1H NMRspectrum. Still, the MS showed only the peak of the quinolinecage at m/z=3418 with its characteristic isotopic distributionpattern. Neither under very harsh acidic conditions (concen-trated sulfuric acid, pH /C01.9), nor under harsh basicconditions (concentrated NaOH, pH 15.2) does the com-pound decompose. The nearly quantitative recovered mate-rial was neutralized and the recorded1H NMR spectra againshowed no difference to the compound before treatment. Thisrange is to the best of our knowledge, the largest pH windowin which a shape-persistent organic cage is stable (forcomparison the [4+6] amide cage is pH-stable from /C01t o14.5).[15]It is worth mentioning that 1decomposes at pH 3 orbeyond pH 11 (see the Supporting Information).",topology
"In contrast to the previously reported [4 +6] amide cage,the extended fused aromatic quinoline units allowed us tostudy the acidochromism of this cage. By the naked eye,a clear color change is detected both in the solid state and insolution. Under basic or pH neutral conditions the compoundis pale yellow, whereas when acidic it is bright red to orange(Figure 7).

"To summarize, a chemically and thermally very robustshape-persistent quinoline cage has been synthesized in 25%yield by a twelve-fold Povarov reaction of a [4+6] salicyliminecage with phenylacetylene. In contrast to prior post function-alizations of this and other imine cages,[14,15,29]this conversionwas achieved in one step.

"The synthesis of PTM -TC can be  performed in a reaction scale up to  at least 300 mg in one pot . The self-assembly synthetic reaction  can be carried out successfully in a variety of organic solvents . The feasible solvents for self -assembly have two features, including  i) the solvent should provide enough S6  solubility for PTM -P (at least around 1 mg/mL) , ii) the solvent molecule should have a complementary size  to occupy the cavity of  PTM -TC so that the former acts as a template for the cage formation.  Our experiments demonstrated that the feasible solvents include  chlorobenzene, benzene, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, pyridine, and mesitylene  (for ESI -MS and EPR characterizations, see the Figure S 16 and S17).  It＊s noteworthy that the self -assembly of PTM -TC should be performed within no longer than  12 hours  at 60 oC and reaction temperature  higher than  90 oC should be avoided. This is because PTM radical might undergo  decomposition/hydrogenation at elevated temperature ( i.e., 90 oC) or if the reaction time is too long . In fact, in the case of  reaction temperature higher than 90 oC, the condensation of PTM -P and TREN  led to light red precipitates which cannot be dissolve in all of the common ly used  solvents , indicating the generation of oligomers or polymers (Figure S 7 b). We recorded the h igh-resolution MS  of the solution phase of the reaction mixture, which  demonstrated the formation of the analogues of PTM -TC, whose four PTM radical units are   all or partially hydrogenated (Figure S7  d).",comprehensive synthesis

"[14]Here, a radical cage containing four spin centers was self-assembled in high yield in a one-pot manner by condensinga trisamine and a trisformyl radical in a [4+4] manner. Withineach cage framework, intramolecular interactions such as[CH﹞﹞﹞ p] and hydrogen-bonding occur. Such interactionsresult in chiral self-sorting in the cage formation.[15]That is,even although the propeller-shaped trisformyl precursor hastwo atropisomeric forms, each cage contains only one type ofthese two atropisomers. Such chiral self-sorting results in thecage having two enantiomeric isomers, which were isolatedvia chiral HPLC. Once isolated, each enantiomer of the cagehas stable homochirality, probably because the inter-compo-nent steric hindrance prevents flipping of the phenyl unitswithin the cage framework. Magnetic characterization showsthat the self-assembled radical cage behaves as a group oforganized while independent radicals, resulting from therelatively long distances between the radical carbon centers.",topology
"PTM radicals are reported to be highly stable because oftheir three polychlorophenyl units that are grafted onto thecentral sp2hybridized radical carbon atom.[1c,16]On the onehand, such three units, which are rather bulky, protect theradical from dimerization. On the other hand, the phenylunits undergo resonance with the central radical electron,stabilizing the latter from either reduction or oxidation. Inaddition, because of the steric hindrance between polychlor-ophenyl units, PTM adopts a propeller-like conformation,resulting in two atropisomers, namely Plus (P) and Minus(M). The energy barrier of these two atropisomers under-going interconversion was determined to be ca. 23 kcalmol/C01,as indicated by Veciana and Crespo a few decades ago.[17]A trisaldehyde precursor containing a PTM radicalmoiety ( PTM-P ) was synthesized from its correspondingpolychlorotriphenylmethane ( PTM-H )[18]by deprotonationwith nBu4N﹞OH, followed by oxidation with p-chloranil(Figure 1). Combining PTM-H and tris(2-aminoethyl)amine(TREN) in a 1:1 ratio in CHCl3at room temperature, onlyproduced some intractable oligomers, probably because theformation of tetrahedrons require the trisformyl precursor toadopt a planar triangular geometry, instead of the pyramidshape that PTM-H has. Raising the reaction temperature to608C did not improve the self-assembly outcome. As a com-parison, combining PTM-P , which is indeed a mixture of twoatropisomers namely PandMisomers, and TREN in a 1:1.05ratio in C6H5Cl and CH2Cl2mixture (95:5 by volume) at 60 8Cproduced a clear red solution containing PTM-TC (Figure 1)as the predominant product. The formation of the [4 +4]tetrahedron PTM-TC was confirmed by high-resolution massspectrometry (HRMS) (Figure 2a, S6). The peaks corre-sponding to [ M+2H]2+,[M+3H]3+, and [ M+4H]4+wereobserved at m/z2123.7022, 1416.1350, and 1062.3533, con-sistent with the calculated values.Abstract: Condensation of an inherently C3-symmetric poly-chlorotriphenylmethyl (PTM) radical trisaldehyde with tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (TREN) yields a [4+4] tetrahedral radicalcage as a racemic pair of homochiral enantiomers in 75%isolated yield. The structure was characterized by X-raycrystallography, confirming the homochirality of each cageframework. The homochirality results from intramolecular[CH﹞﹞﹞ p] and hydrogen-bonding interactions within the cageframework. The four PTM radicals in a cage undergo weakthrough-space coupling. Magnetic measurements demon-strated that each cage bears 3.58 spins.",topology

The industrial separation of C 2H4from ethane(C2H6) is typically through cryogenic distillation at high pressureand very low temperature, using very high towers, because theyhave similar sizes and volatilities2. Such a process is highly energyconsuming, and thus exploring of other effective C 2H4separationmethods at ambient conditions is highly demanded. Selectiveadsorption by porous materials for producing high-purity C 2H4has been determined to be one of the most desired methods for itslow energy consumption3,4. Of particular recent interest in thisregard is using C 2H6-selective porous materials enriched withnonpolar/inert surfaces (e.g., introducing aromatic or aliphaticentities), because they prefer to capture more polarizable C 2H6,and thus can directly afford high-purity C 2H4in a singleadsorption step, avoiding an additional high-energy-consumingdesorption step5,6. So far, most of the developed C 2H6-selectiveadsorbents are metal-containing materials6每10. However, thepolar metal centers in these materials can interact with unsatu-rated C 2H4molecules via strong 羽-complexation interactions, andthus weaken their C 2H6/C2H4separation abilities11. Therefore,developing other C 2H6-selective adsorbents such as metal-freeorganic porous materials is highly required12,13, because theycannot only avoid the abovementioned problem, but also areeasier to construct inert surfaces. However, the research of suchmaterials is still in its initial stage14,15.",affiliation

"ARTICLEEf?cient ethylene puri ?cation by a robustethane-trapping porous organic cageKongzhao Su1,2,4, Wenjing Wang1,4, Shunfu Du1,3, Chunqing Ji1,2& Daqiang Yuan1,2?The removal of ethane (C 2H6) from its analogous ethylene (C 2H4) is of paramountimportance in the petrochemical industry, but highly challenging due to their similarphysicochemical properties. The use of emerging porous organic cage (POC) materials forC2H6/C2H4separation is still in its infancy. Here, we report the benchmark example of atruncated octahedral calix[4]resorcinarene-based POC adsorbent (CPOC-301), preferring toadsorb C2H6than C 2H4, and thus can be used as a robust absorbent to directly separatehigh-purity C 2H4from the C 2H6/C2H4mixture. Molecular modelling studies suggest theexceptional C 2H6selectivity is due to the suitable resorcin[4]arene cavities in CPOC-301,which form more multiple C 每H﹞﹞﹞羽hydrogen bonds with C 2H6than with C 2H4guests.

Notably, their upper rims can beeasily functionalized, making them good molecular buildingblocks for constructing self-assembled cages as well as porouspolymers50每56.

"DiscussionIn conclusion, a pair of axially chiral [4 +6] PAC ( 1-Sand1-R)i sconstructed from the condensation of binaphthylenediamine andtridentate aldehyde. As far as we know, this is one of the fewexamples of chiral POCs having the aromatic structure reportedto date. The keto-enol tautomerism-induced conversion of imineto amine is observed in the cage assembly. The keto-enaminestructure renders PAC 1an exceptional stability under water andconcentrated acid while the hydrophobic characteristic is crucialfor alkali resistance. Controllable chiral self-sorting at bothmolecular and supramolecular levels is observed. DFT calcula-tions show that the exclusive self-recognition on single cageformation is an enthalpy-driven process, while the narcissisticand social self-sorting on cage-cage supramolecular assembly isregulated by different solvents via C 每H＃羽and羽每羽interactions.The reversible transformation of the homochiral cage and race-mic structure is studied by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.",topology

Recrystallization of solid in dichloromethane and methanol led to the precipitation of white microcrystal, which was dried at room temperature, giving BDTC in the yield of 62% (235.2 mg). It is worth noting that BTDDP is insoluble in dichloromethane, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, and only sparingly soluble in DMSO.

"11﹜BPPOC displays very low N 2uptake at even 1.0 bar, giving alow Brunauer ?Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 52 m2g?1,Figure S23 . Instead, on the basis of CO 2adsorption data at196 K, Figure S24 , the BET surface area of BPPOC is 577 m2g?1, similar to that of BTPOC (605 m2g?1) under the sametest conditions.12Activated USTB-1 and USTB-2 degassed at100 ∼C show a type-I gas sorption curve at 77 K, Figure 3 ,indicating the microporous characteristics of these twomaterials. The BET surface areas were calculated to be 1322m2g?1for USTB-1 and 322 m2g?1for USTB-2. The pore sizedistribution study reveals the dual-pore structure with the sizeof 1.88 and 2.18 nm for USTB-1 and 1.89 and 2.15 nm forUSTB-2, Figure 3 a?d. The values for both materials are quiteclose to the theoretical pore sizes of 1.84 and 2.02 nm,con?rming their same Kagome lattice nature.",surface area
"12﹜14The total porevolumes were calculated as 0.66 and 0.22 cm3g?1for USTB-1and USTB-2, respectively. For USTB-3, Figure 3 e, the verysmall BET surface area of 20 m2g?1might also be due to itspoor crystalline state, preventing us from ?tting the pore sizedistribution. As for the cage-derived COFs ranging fromUSTB-1c to USTB-4c, their BET surface areas weresigni?cantly enhanced to 1454, 365, 598, and 441 m2g?1,respectively. The pore sizes of USTB-1c and USTB-2c areoverall consistent with the theoretical values deduced from thepredesigned COF structures, Figure 3 b,d. This is also true forUSTB-3c (1.71 and 2.08 nm) and USTB-4c (1.81 and 2.04nm), Figure 3 f,h. At the end of this paragraph, it is noteworthythat the BET surface area of 193 m2g?1for USTB-4 ∩is smallerthan that of USTB-4c (441 m2g?1),Figure S25 , con?rming thein?uence of di ?erent starting materials on the preparation ofhigh-quality COFs.",surface area
"14﹜15?21A variety of adsorbents including MOFs,15COFs,16?18and POCs12,19?21have been disclosed to exhibithigh-e ?ciency iodine capture performance in comparison withcommercial zeolites and active carbons. In the present case, theisolated POCs and 2D COFs possessing well-de ?ned porousstructures in combination with their heteroatom-rich molecularmodule nature most probably endow them with good I2capture properties by forming charge-transfer species.12,18Asa consequence, the iodine vapor capture experiments wereperformed on two POCs and seven COFs at 348 K. BPPOCdisplays the iodine adsorption amount of 5.34 g g?1after 20 hand gets saturated with 5.64 g g?1after 50 h, Figure 4 a,b. Theiodine vapor adsorption capability of this cage is better thanthe POC benchmarks including OMC319(3.78 g g?1), BPy-Cage20(3.23 g g?1), and CC321(0.45 g g?1). However, thesulfur-rich cage BTPOC shows a much lower iodine vaporadsorption uptake of 3.21 g g?1than the nitrogen-richcounterpart BPPOC despite their similar BET surfaceareas,12revealing the nitrogen-rich superiority in iodinecapture. Actually, such a high iodine vapor adsorption behaviorof BPPOC surpasses the excellent organic adsorbates such asmolecular crystals,22conjugated microporous polymers,23andporous aromatic frameworks,24Figure 4 c and Table S4 .USTB-1 exhibits a moderately high iodine vapor captureuptake of 4.45 g g?1. The other two directly prepared dual-poreCOFs, USTB-2 and USTB-3, show slightly lower iodine vaporcapacities with the uptake of 4.38 and 3.14 g g?1, respectively,Figure 4 a. Their di ?erence in iodine vapor capacities might beattributed to the synergy e ?ect between the heteroatomcomponent and experimental pore volumes. Interestingly,cage-derived USTB-1c was revealed to display an enhancediodine vapor capacity of 5.80 g g?1in comparison with that ofUSTB-1 (4.45 g g?1). This is indeed also true for the increasediodine uptake of 4.57 and 3.30 g g?1for USTB-2c and USTB-3c, respectively, compared wi th their directly preparedcounterparts, due probably to the formation of more porositybetween cage-derived COF crystallites than the directlyprepared species according to the higher experimental N2uptake at 1 bar revealed by the adsorption curves. USTB-4cpossesses a moderate iodine adsorption amount of 3.02 g g?1.",surface area
"1﹜In the present case, the nitrogen-rich COFs, USTB-1 (1c) andUSTB-2 (2c), seem to exhibit higher iodine vapor uptakes thanthe corresponding sulfur-rich species USTB-3 (3c) and USTB-4c, respectively, under the same conditions. This is actuallyconsistent with the phenomena observed for POCs asmentioned above. However, it is noteworthy that both thenitrogen-rich structure nature and high surface area (porosity)play an important role in the I2vapor uptake of COFs.",surface area
"2﹜Nevertheless, additional sites such as interlayers also contributeto I2capture of COFs, as indicated by the larger absorbed I2volume (0.90 and 1.18 cm3g?1) than the experimental porevolume (0.66 and 1.01 cm3g?1) of USTB-1 and USTB-1c,respectively. This then should be responsible for the similar I2adsorption uptakes for USTB-3 and USTB-3c possessing verydi?erent BET surface areas.",surface area

| BPPOC                              | Herein, a new single-crystal [3 + 6] topological POC (BPPOC) was obtained from the condensation between 3 equiv 2,2'-bipyridine-based tetraaldehyde (BPDDP) molecules and 6 equiv R,R-cyclohexanediamine molecules, catalyzed by trifluoroacetic acid. | 2143974 | BPPOC displays very low N?? uptake at even 1.0 bar, giving a low Brunauer每Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 52 m??/g. Instead, on the basis of CO?? adsorption data at 196 K, the BET surface area of BPPOC is 577 m??/g, similar to that of BTPOC (605 m??/g) under the same test conditions. | Synthesis of BPPOC. To a suspension of BPDDP (210.2 mg, 0.5 mmol) and TFA (5.0 米L) in dichloromethane (450.0 mL), a solution of chiral R,R-cyclohexanediamine (125.6 mg, 1.1 mmol) in dichloromethane (50.0 mL) was added slowly and stirred at room temperature. After 48 h, the reaction mixture was filtered. The filtrate was then evaporated under reduced pressure. Recrystallization of the crude product in dichloromethane and methanol led to the precipitation of the target organic cage as a light yellow powder, which was dried at room temperature, giving BPPOC in the yield of 81% (209 mg). | BPDDP | A mixture of 5,5 ∩-dibromo-2,2 ∩-bipyridine (628.0 mg, 2.0 mmol), 5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)isophthalaldehyde (1100.0 mg, 4.2 mmol), potassium carbonate (1000.0 mg, 7.2 mmol), tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (150.0 mg, 0.1 mmol), tetrahydrofuran (18.0 mL), and water (2.0 mL) in a 50 mL flask was stirred at 95 ∼C under a nitrogen atmosphere. After 24 h, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and filtered. The crude product was washed with water (10.0 mL), tetrahydrofuran (10.0 mL), and methanol (10.0 mL) and finally dried at room temperature, affording BPDDP (ca. 700 mg) with a yield of 83%. | R,R-cyclohexanediamine | None |

"10,17In morerecent studies using high-throughput robotics to automate thesynthesis of scrambled POC mixtures,18it was found that mixturesof vicinal diamines did not always lead to the formation of astatistical distribution of cage species. In particular, one combi-nation involving 2-methylpropane -1,2-diamine (MPDA, used in thesynthesis of CC13 ,191 equiv.) and (3 R,4R)-2,5-dimethylhexane-3,4-diamine (DMHDA, 5 equiv.) led to t he isolation of a novel isopropyldecorated parent cage, CC21 , albeit in a low 5% yield (Fig. 1a).18When the direct synthesis of CC21 was then attempted using6 equivalents of DMHDA in CHCl 3,a n di nt h ea b s e n c eo fM P D A ,the parent cage was not isolated. In stead, an alternative tri-aminalside-product (1,3,5-tris(4,5-diisop ropyl-imidazolidin-2-yl)benzene,Fig. 1b) was formed and isolated in 33% yield. These preliminaryresults prompted us to carry out further investigations into theformation of CC21 . Here, we report the synthesis, characterisation,and investigation into the formation and properties of this newPOC, which proved to be both highly soluble and have unusualcrystal packing, likely due to the presence of the sterically bulkyisopropyl functionalities on the cage vertices.aDepartment of Chemistry and Materials Innovation Factory, University ofLiverpool, 51 Oxford Street, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK.E-mail: aicooper@liverpool.ac.ukbDepartment of Chemistry, Molecular Sciences Research Hub, Imperial CollegeLondon, 82 Wood Lane, London, W12 0BZ, UK.E-mail: r.greenaway@imperial.ac.uk?Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Full computational,experimental and characterisation details.

Notably,the PXRD pattern for the activated bulk sample crystallisedfrom CH2Cl2matches the simulated PXRD of CC21a (ESI, ?Fig. S23), and we used this sample for N 2gas sorptionanalysis at 77.3 K (ESI, ?Fig. S24). CC21a was found to adsorb11.1 mmol g/C01of N 2at 1 bar and 77.3 K, and has a Brunauer藩Emmett藩Teller (BET) surface area of 699 m2g/C01. PXRD datarecorded post gas sorption analysis revealed that CC21a did notchange structure during this measurement (ESI, ?Fig. S23),indicating that the bulky isopropyl groups do not affect thestability of the activated material. This data also proves thatCC21 is shape persistent in the solid state and retains its cavityin the absence of solvent. Computational assessment of theporosity of the obtained crystal structure suggests that channelsthrough the structure are approximately the size of an N2molecule, which allows for nitrogen adsorption (ESI, ?Fig. S29).",surface area

Cages of larger sizes, whichwere characterized in the solid state by X-ray diffraction ofsingle-crystals were synthesized by the Cooper group,[12b]theSeverin group,[12c]and Gawronski et al.[12d](see also theSupporting Information, Figure S27). Whereas the Coopercage had an outer diameter of 2.9 nm and inner diameter of1.5 nm, which is similar to a previously reported [4+6] cagecompound,[4c]the Gawronski cage was larger, especially whenthe inner cavity dimensions were taken into account (outerdiameter: 3.0 nm, inner diameter: 1.7 nm). By a combinationof metallasupramolecular chemistry and dynamic imine bondformation, Severin and co-workers prepared a cage with outerand inner diameters of 2.7 nm and 1.9 nm, respectively.Unfortunately, these larger cages failed to remain porousupon desolvation of the crystals: mainly nonporous com-pounds were observed, as has been verified by gas sorptionmeasurements.[*] Dr. G.

"Abstract: Recently, porous organic cage crystals have becomea real alternative to extended framework materials with highspecific surface areas in the desolvated state. Although majorprogress in this area has been made, the resulting porouscompounds are restricted to the microporous regime, owing tothe relatively small molecular sizes of the cages, or the collapseof larger structures upon desolvation. Herein, we present thesynthesis of a shape-persistent cage compound by the reversibleformation of 24 boronic ester units of 12 triptycene tetraolmolecules and 8 triboronic acid molecules. The cage com-pound bears a cavity of a minimum inner diameter of 2.6 nmand a maximum inner diameter of 3.1 nm, as determined bysingle-crystal X-ray analysis. The porous molecular crystalscould be activated for gas sorption by removing enclathratedsolvent molecules, resulting in a mesoporous material witha very high specific surface area of 3758 m2g/C01and a porediameter of 2.3 nm, as measured by nitrogen gas sorption.",surface area

Using thismethod, the average pore diameter of the material wasdetermined to be 2.3 nm, which is in good agreement with themolecular pore size determined from the X-ray crystalstructure of solvate 3b. The crystalline phases of thedesolvated and solvated structures are not the same, as hasbeen found by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). However,owing to the accordance of the measured pore size, both byNLDFTand DR methods to that calculated from the solvatedphase, it is suggested that the molecular cages retain theirshape and remain intact during evacuation, but the assem-bling of the cages in the desolvated phase have changed.",surface area
"Solving crystal structures from PXRD data of such structuresis not trivial, and further work will be done to get more insightinto the occurring phase change during evacuation. The shapeof the sorption isotherms is similar to that reported for MIL-101, and the pore dimensions and surface areas of the cagecompound 3bare indeed comparable to MIL-101 ( Vpore=2.0 cm3g/C01; BET SA =4100 m2g/C01).[20]All data are readilyreproducible, as has been demonstrated by the synthesis andmeasurement of a second batch sample (BET SA =3475 m2g/C01). The specific surface area of 3bis higher thanfor COF-102 (BET SA =3472 m2g/C01),[21]and is the highestreported thus far for any porous cage compound. To the bestof our knowledge, 3balso represents the first single-crystal X-ray structure of any reported crystalline porous organicmaterial based on the formation of boronic esters.",surface area
"In conclusion, we have shown that it is possible tosynthesize a shape-persistent, discrete mesoporous organiccage compound by dynamic covalent formation of 24 boronicester units in one step. The resulting BET specific surface areaof 3758 m2g/C01is the highest reported thus far for any porousorganic molecules. Currently, we are working on the synthesisof even larger porous cages to gain further insight into thescope and limitations of this new and fascinating class ofporous materials.",surface area

Powder XRD (PXRD)  Routine powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were collected using Cu K汐 radiation (竹 = 1.5418 ?, 40 kV and 30 mA) on a PANalytical X＊pert PRO instrument operating in Bragg-Brentano geometry. Intensity data were recorded using an X＊Celerator detector, and 2牟 scans in the range of 4?40∼ were performed with a step size of 0.02∼ at a scan speed of 0.02 (∼/s). The sample was placed in a zero-background sample holder and normal configuration of the instrument was used.  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)   NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 500 MHz. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm relative to the signals corresponding to the residual non-deuterated solvents. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)  Thermogravimetric analysis was carried out using an automatic sample loading TA Instruments Q5000 analyzer. The instrument records weight loss as a function of temperature. It was used to determine onset temperature and temperature ranges of the guest loss and sample degradation. Usually a sample of 0.5-4 mg was heated starting at room temperature to 1000 ∼C in a standard TA instrument aluminum pan at a heating rate of 10 K min-1. Samples were analyzed under constant flow of dry nitrogen gas at a flow rate of 50 ml min-1. TGA traces were analyzed and figures generated using OriginLab 2019. Xylene Selectivity Studies in Vapor To study the xylene vapor kinetics on AZO-Cages, samples of 10 mg were exposed to 95% relative pressure of each xylene vapor for different time intervals. PXRD was measured during 1, 4, and 24 hr after drying the sample in the fume hood for 4 hr. The amount of uptake was determined based on weight and TGA to be ~11%.

"A 1:3 mixture of 1a (2 mg, 0.004 mmol) and (1 S,2S)-2-aminocyclohexanol ( S-3l) (1.38 mg, 0.012 mmol) was combined in CDCl 3 (0.6 mL) ( Scheme S1 ). The corresponding reaction mixtures were stirred at 25 ∼C for 8 h.  1H NMR spectra ( Figure S1a) indicated the formation of S-4l as the major product.  Subsequently, tris(2 -aminoethyl)amine (TREN) (0.58 mg, 0.004 mmo) was added to the above reaction solution. The mixtures were stirred at room temperature for 8 h, yielding to the formation of 2a and release of S-3l via imine exchange . The 1H NMR ( Figure S1b ) and MS s pectra  (Figure S2 ) of 2a are consistent with our previous publication, both confirming the formation of the tetrahedral cage[1a].",comprehensive synthesis

However, their structural complexity presents formidable challenge in elucidating their kinetics, especially when multiple structural motions are intercorrelated. We herein introduce a twin-cavity cage that features interconvertible C3- and C1-configurations, each configuration exhibiting interchangeable P- and M-conformations. This molecule is therefore composed of four interconnected chiral species (P)-C3, (M)-C3, (P)-C1, (M)-C1. We showcase an effective methodology to decouple these sophisticated structural changes into two kinetically distinct pathways. Utilizing time-dependent 1H NMR spectroscopy at various temperatures, which disregards the transition between mirror-image conformations, we first determine the rate constant (kc) for C3- to C1-configuration interconversion; while time-dependent circular dichroism spectroscopy at different temperatures quantifies the observed rate constant (kobs) of ensemble of all structural changes. As kobs >> kc, it allows us to decouple the overall molecular motions into a slow configurational transformation and rapid conformational interconversions, the latter further dissected into two independent 10.1002/anie.202405858Accepted ManuscriptAngewandte Chemie International EditionThis article is protected by copyright.

Materials Reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification, unless other indicated. 1-(3,5-Dibromophenyl)ethanone, (3-((tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino)phenyl)boronic acid and catalysts tetrakis-(triphenylphosphine)-palladium [Pd(PPh3)4] and [1,1＊-bis(diphenylphosphino)-ferrocene]dichloropalladium(II) [Pd(dppf)Cl2] were purchased from Bidepharm, China. Bis(pinacolato)diboron ((Bpin)2), 1,3-dibromobenzene, phloroglucinol, formamidine acetate, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), scandium(III) trifluoromethanesulfonate [Sc(OTf)3] were purchased from Adamas-beta, China. Thionylchloride (SOCl2), and inorganic salts including potassium carbonate, potassium acetate, sodium bicarbonate and magnesium sulfate were purchased from Greagent, China. Flash column chromatography was performed on silica gel (200每300 mesh) and the compounds were visualized under 254 nm on thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates.  2. Techniques 2.1 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker A VANCE III HD 400, Bruker AVANCE III HD 500, or Bruker A VANCE NEO 700 NMR spectrometer. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured at 298.15 K in CDCl3, C2D2Cl4 or DMSO-d6. Their proton and 13carbon residuals are used as internal references for 1H and 13C NMR, respectively. Proton chemical shifts (汛) are reported in ppm and coupling constants (J) in Hertz (Hz). The multiplicity in the 1H NMR spectra are described as s (singlet); d (doublet); dd (doublet of doublets); t (triplet); q (quartet); m (multiplet); br (broad). Time-dependent 1H NMR spectra were recorded in C2D2Cl4 at different temperatures on a Bruker AVANCE III HD 500 spectrometer with different time intervals. Quantitative 13C NMR spectrum was measured in C2D2Cl4 at 298.15 K on a Bruker AVANCE NEO 700 NMR spectrometer, employing 1024 scans and a relaxation delay (D1) of 15 s following the addition of relaxation reagent chromium(III) acetylacetonate. S4  2.2 Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometry MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed on a Bruker Autoflex speed TOF/TOF mass spectrometer and operated in reflective mode. Internal calibration was performed using peptide (700?3500 Dalton) as standards. The analytical samples were obtained by mixing the CHCl3 solution of the sample (5 mg mL?1) and CH2Cl2 solution of the matrix (trans-2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propene]-malononitrile (DCTB, 10 mg mL?1) in a 1/5 (v/v) ratio. The prepared mixture solution of the sample (1 米L) was loaded on the MALDI-TOF plate and allowed to dry at room temperature before the plate was inserted into the vacuum chamber of the MALDI-TOF instrument. 2.3 Single Crystal X-Ray Diffractometry (SC-XRD) The single crystal data of configuration-1 of Diphane-5 was collected on Bruker D8 VENTURE. The structure was solved by direct methods using the OLEX-2 software. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined using anisotropic thermal parameters. The refined single crystal data are listed in Table S10. 2.4 Circular Dichroism (CD) Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was performed with a JASCO J-1500 spectrometer. Time-dependent CD spectra were performed in C2D2Cl4 at various temperatures and different time intervals, utilizing 1 mm quartz cuvettes. The experimental conditions included a scan rate of 500 nm﹞min?1, a response time of 1 s and a bandwidth of 5 nm.  2.5 Density Functional Theory (DFT) All calculations were executed using the Gaussian 16 A.03 program[S1] with default procedures, algorithms and integration grids. The initial structure, derived from single crystal analysis, underwent optimization employing the hybrid functional B3LYP[S2?S5] coupled with the 6-31G(d,p) basis level.[S6?S8]  To determine the valid thermodynamic potential for different isomers (at 298.15 K, 1.0 atm), we conducted vibrational frequency calculations using optimized molecular S5  geometry, simulating the solvent 1,2-dichloroethane within the SMD framework. Specifically, frequency calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level[S6?S8]. Additionally, to identify possible transition states during the interconversion between the C3- and C1-configurations resulting from the rotation of the carbon-carbon bond, we conducted transition state searches by employing the Berny geometry optimization algorithm from various possible starting structures at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level.[S6?S8] In these calculations, the solvent chloroform was also simulated within the SMD framework. To ensure consistency with UV-Vis absorption and CD experiments, ground state optimizations and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations were conducted, simulating the solvent 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane with 1,2-dichloroethane (汍 = 10.36) as a solvent within the Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM) framework.[S9] The calculated frontier orbitals of Diphane-5 are displayed in Figure S31. Frequency calculations were performed with no imaginary frequency found for the optimized molecular geometry. TD-DFT calculations were conducted using optimized molecular geometry, considering the first 50 transitions (singlet:triplet = 50:50). The solvent 1,2-dichloroethane was simulated within PCM framework. Specifically, TD-DFT calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level.[S10] Electronic transitions were visualized using GaussSum 3.0,[S11] setting the full width half maximum (FWHM) to 2500 cm?1 for predicted UV-vis absorption spectra, and the 考 value is set to 0.5 eV for predicted CD spectra. Excited state hole-electron analysis was carrying out using Multiwfn 3.8 (dev).[S12]  3. Synthesis of Precursors and Diphane-5 The syntheses of all chemical compounds are described as follows. Diphane-5 was synthesized by the condensation of aldehyde and amide and following keto-enol tautomerization according to our previous literature.[S13] 2,4,6-Trihydroxybenzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde (TP), tris(N-salicylideneaniline) (TSAN) and 1,3,5-tris(3,5-dibromophenyl)benzene (compound 1) were synthesized according to the literature S6  procedure.[S14?S16] 1H and 13C NMR spectra of all compounds are listed after their synthetic procedures and proton assignments are given in corresponding spectra in Section 4 and 12.",this paper's author

Prior to the measurements, the samples were degassed  for 10 h at 100 ∼C. UHP  grade N2, H2, CH 4 and CO 2 were  used for measurements. Oil-free  vacuum pumps and oil-free pressure  regulators were  used for measurements to prevent  contamination of the samples during the degassing  process  and isotherm measurement. The total pore volume  was N2 volume adsorbed at STP when P/P 0 was 0.95. The BET surface  area was calculated in the 0.10-0.20 P/P 0 range,  and the isotherm  points chosen to calculate the BET surface  area were subject to the three consistency criteria detailed by Walton and SnurrS2.2.

This new typeof porous material is solution-processable, which sets it apartfrom other porous materials such as zeolites or the well-knownextended network materials ( e.g., metal每organic frameworks3),which sparked increasing interest in OMCs over the past fiveyears.4Cooper,5Mastalerz,6Zhang7and others8have reported avariety of OMCs, and among the resultant porous materials cannow be found examples with high selectivity for the adsorption ofCO2over N 26b,7aor with a high Brunauer每Emmett每Teller (BET)surface area of up to 3758 m2g/C01.6dHowever, it has to beemphasized that, this new area is still far away from being well-explored. The synthesis of large O MCs is still quite challengingand sometimes it is difficult5bto self-assemble these largemolecules into stable porous materials with high surface area,no matter whether crystalline or in an amorphous state.",surface area

Commun., 2015, 51, 1976--1979 This journal is ?The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015Cooper group.5aAdditionally, the volume calculated for thecage amounts to 2073 ?3by the volume of the inscribed sphere,which is also larger than that of CC5 (1356 ?3). In its crystallo-graphic packing, strong CH每 pinteractions between the bridge-head proton atoms of cyclohexane and the aromatic rings werefound, evidenced by a distance of 2.94每2.97 ?. The self-assembly mode observed for cage 1differs somewhat fromthose reported for other [4+6] OMCs, as the cyclohexane moietyof cage 1is able to insert itself into the cavity of an adjacentcage to form a one-dimensional (1D) supramolecular chain(Fig. 2b). These 1D supramolecular chains further self-assemble into a porous molecular packing through p每pstack-ing (Fig. 2c) between the triazine and benzene rings witha distance from 3.66 to 3.86 ?, which is a typical distance forp每pstacking interactions. This packing mode partially blocksthe inherently present pore of cage 1(B2070 ?3) and leads to awinding pore structure in the solid state crystal of cage 1. Thecage 1has a pore volume of 6738 ?3per unit cell with a proberadius of 1.82 ?, or 39.1% of the total volume of the material, asindicated by the orange Connolly surface representation inFig. 2d. From this structure, the cage was calculated17usingthe Poreblazer program to have an accessible surface area of987 m2g/C01.",surface area
"To investigate the permanent porosity of cage 1, a crystallinesample of cage 1was treated for 10 h at 100 1C under highvacuum. Powder X-ray di?raction (PXRD) analysis showed thatcage 1loses its crystallinity during the activation process andchanges into an amorphous state. However, as most of theporosity of cage 1is inherent to its molecular structure ratherthan to solid state packing e?ects, the resultant amorphoussample still features considerable gas uptake properties. Asshown in Fig. 3a, the N2sorption isotherm of desolvated cage 1at 77 K shows a type I isotherm with a type IV character athigher relative pressures. The total pore volume was estimatedto be 0.54 cm3g/C01, and the calculated BET surface area was1181 m2g/C01, which is comparable to that of the largest [4+6]cages reported so far by Cooper5a(CC5, 1333 m2g/C01) andMastalerz6b(1375 m2g/C01). The experimental pore volume andthe BET surface area of cage 1are both larger than thetheoretical values calculated from the single crystal data(0.50 cm3g/C01and 987 m2g/C01, respectively), which presumablyresults from the solvent release process during heat andvacuum treatment of cage 1. In order for the quite voluminousDMSO molecules to be released from the cage cavity, thecyclohexane substituents blocking the path of the DMSO mole-cules have to be moved aside. As a result, the sample loses itscrystallographic order and becomes amorphous (the processappears to be not reversible), but also eliminates the location-obstruction between cages due to cyclohexane insertion and theinherent molecular pores of the cages are re-established. TheH2adsorption isotherm of cage 1(Fig. 3b) shows a 80 cm3g/C01and 58 cm3g/C01H2uptake at 77 K and 87 K under 1 bar,respectively, which also compares well with other [4+6] cages.",surface area

Dioxane (96 mL) and H2O (24 mL) were bubbled with N2 for 15 minutes and then added into the flask under N2. The reaction was kept at 85∼C with stirring for 24 hours. After the reaction, the solvents were removed by rotary evaporation, and the residue was extracted with DCM and brine. The organic phase was collected and dried over anhydrous MgSO4 to get the crude product, which was purified by column chromatography with EA/PE (1/2) as the eluents to yield compound 2 (2141 mg, 72%) as a yellow powder. | Compound 2 | Compound 2 (2141 mg, 2.86 mmol) was charged into a 200 mL Schlenk flask, which was evacuated and backfilled with N2 for 3 times. Then THF (80 mL) was added by syringe to form a yellow solution. Phosphorus tribromide (PBr3, 1.1 mL, 11.5 mmol) was diluted in THF (5 mL) and added dropwise into the THF solution of compound 2 under an ice bath. Then the reaction was slowly warmed to 25∼C and further reacted for 8 hours with stirring. After the reaction, 2 mL deionized water was added to quench the residual PBr3. THF was removed by rotary evaporation, and the residue was dissolved in DCM to get a concentrated solution. Then the solution was added into MeOH drop by drop. The precipitation in MeOH was collected by centrifugation to get the pure product as light-green powder (2341 mg, 87%). |

"←RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSynthesis and Characterization ofthe Helical Cages(HCs). Pyromellitic dianhydride (BDA) was first covalentlymodified with two chiral cyclohexanediamine (R/ScHDAm) toproduce pyromellitic diimide (R/SBDI) astheedge (Figures S1and S2), and tris(4-formylphenyl)amine (TPA) was selected asthe facet, which were linked together bydynamic covalentimine bonds4toconstructR/SHC (Figure 1aand Schemes S1?S3inthe Supporting Information). Due tothe high directionrole ofintrinsically chiral V-shapedR/ScHDAm and thedynamic reactivity ofimine bonds,R/SHC were obtained athigh isolated yields (>60%) incomparison with most covalentmolecular cages. Only one molecular ionpeak was detected at1782.74138 m/z (M +H) in high-resolution massspectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS, Figures 1b, S3, and S4),confirming adiscrete [3+2]-type molecular cage structure withthreeR/SBDI and two TPA moieties.1HNMR spectroscopyfurther showed that allofthe formyl groups were convertedinto the imine bonds, and allofthe protons onR/SBDI andFigure1.Molecular design, synthesis, and characterizations.

"We previously developed a synthetic strategy to constructcatenane with two dissymmetric cages (CDC).14We startedfrom the catenane composed of two symmetric cages, namely,CSC-1 . As the inner cavity of CSC-1 is inaccessible byvoluminous NaBH(OAc)3, it allowed us to selectively reduceall imines on its exterior panels, leading to the formation ofCDC-1 .S i m i l a r l y , CDC-5 was produced by a two-stepprocedure. A [4 + 6] cycloimination reaction of four TFBpanels and six (4 R)-2-(3,5-di(3-aminophenyl)phenyl)-4-meth-yl-1,3-dithiane ( DAPMD ) linkers ?rst yielded CSC-5 . Thesubsequent selective reduction of the exterior imines of CSC-5by bulky reductant NaBH(OAc)3led to the formation ofCDC-5 (44% two-step overall yield, see the SupportingInformation for details). Its chemical structure was con ?rmedby MALDI-TOF and NMR spectroscopies, respectively(Figures S8 ?S12). The MALDI-TOF spectrum of CDC-5shows an ion peak at m/z2799.936 ([M + H]+calcd for2799.927), and its1H NMR spectrum exhibits the resonancesrelated to the exterior amine bonds (protons H b∩and H n∩), theinterior imine bonds (proton Hs∩),TFB (protons Ha∩and Hr∩),and two sets of DAPMD (typically protons H c∩?Hf∩vs protonsHj∩?Hm∩), respectively.",topology

"Results and DiscussionMaterial synthesis and characterizationAccording to our previous report,54,55the FPPOC wassynthesized through dynamic imine chemistry of tri(fu-ran-2-yl) phosphine-based trialdehyde and [( S,S)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine]. Brie ?y, a 2:3 stoichiometric ratioof trialdehyde and diamine was stirred at 40 ∼C in dichlor-omethane (DCM)/MeOH (1:1, v/v) for 5 days to afford apale-yellow solid after recrystallization in methanol(Figure 1aandSupporting Information Scheme S1 ). Theformation of the [2 + 3] assembled molecular cagewas unambiguously con ?rmed by1H/13C/31P NMR, elec-trospray ionization mass spectroscopy analysis, andFourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( SupportingInformation Figures S2 每S9). The solid FPPOC is bench-stable and insoluble in strong polar solvents (e.g.,alcohol, H 2O), but is soluble in DCM or DCM-MeOHmixture while maintaining the prefabricated skeletonstructure. Thermogravimetric analysis demonstrates thatFPPOC has a good thermal stability ( SupportingInformation Figure S10 ). Pd NCs supported on FPPOC(named as Pd@FPPOC) was prepared via a typicalimpregnation-reduction process using Pd(OAc) 2as Pdsource and sodium borohydride (NaBH 4) as thereductant.54To clearly characterize the structure of the obtainedmaterial, comprehensive characterizations were per-formed. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM)image (Figure 1b) shows that ultra ?ne Pd NCs ( ‵2.4 nm)with a narrow size distribution were uniformly dispersedon the surface of FPPOC. Given that the cavity size ofFPPOC54is signi ?cantly smaller than that of Pd NCs, PdNCs are mainly on the outside of the cage cavity. Thehigh-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image (Figure 1c)resolves a characteristic lattice fringe with d spacing of0.222 nm, which corresponds to the (111) plane of atypical metallic Pd face-centered cubic (fcc) structure,a high-angle annular dark- ?eld scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) image, and the corresponding energy-dispersiveX-ray mapping images (Figure 1d) verify that C, N, P, O,and Pd elements were homogeneously distributed with-out any sign of agglomeration, which is supportive of theexcellent dispersity of ultra ?ne Pd NCs in the FPPOCagain. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Figure 2a) showa broad diffraction peak centered at 20∼ for the as-synthesized FPPOC, while a less intensive peak at 40.1∼was detected in Pd@FPPOC, which is indexed to the (111)lattice plane of metallic Pd (JCPDS# 46-1043) with a fccstructure, and is consistent with TEM observation. Thisobservation indicates that Pd NCs are successfully load-ed. The Pd loading amount of Pd@FPPOC was deter-mined to be 19.3 wt % by inductively coupled plasmaoptical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Hence, a mo-lecular cage with high Pd loading content of ultra ?ne NCsand uniform distribution was successfully prepared.",topology

"bSSupporting Information＊INTRODUCTIONMicroporous materials 〞that is, materials with pores smallerthan 2 nm 〞have generated much recent interest.1/C05Recently,porous solids of entirely organic composition have extendedthe range of possible properties and applications. Microporousand mesoporous organic polymers6/C011and covalent organicframeworks (COFs),12,13in particular, have scope for targetedapplications because their constituent building blocks can bereadily diversi ?ed using organic synthesis.14The surface area insuch networks is generated typically via templating or sca ?oldingapproaches;15/C018as such, the porosity is a consequence of thesolid state packing of the building blocks and is ＆extrinsic ＊innature. Other organic materials can exhibit ＆intrinsic ＊porositythat results from the shape of the isolated molecular buildingblocks themselves, for example in the form of syntheticallyprefabricated pores, cavities, or windows. Examples of such ＆porousmolecules,19,20include calixarenes21,22and a range of other smallorganic molecules with shape-persistent covalent cavities.23/C025C a g e - l i k em o l e c u l e sa r ea p p e a l i n ga sp o r o u ss o l i d s .27/C029Re-cently, a family of porous organic cage compounds has beenshown to demonstrate either extrinsic or intrinsic porosity, depend-ing on the packing mode of the cages.30/C034The cavities andwindows in these molecules are created by a reversible [4 + 6]Schi?-base condensation29,35of amine and aldehyde compo-nents. Notably, packing of these cages 〞and hence the porosityof the resulting crystalline solids 〞is in?uenced by the bulkinessof the cage vertices.30The materials have permanent microporestructures and exhibit Brunauer /C0Emmett /C0Teller surface areas(SA BET)o fu pt o6 2 4m2g/C01for smaller cages30and >1300 m2g/C01for a larger [4 + 6] imine cage.32,33In principle, intrinsically porousorganic cages may have advantages over networks and frameworksbecause they are solution processable and can be combined in amodular fashion to generate porous cocrystals comprising morethan one molecular building block.33In general, porous molecular crystals may be expected to havegreater scope for structural rearrangement and polymorphismthan crystalline porous frameworks, such as zeolites, MOFs, andCOFs. This is because molecular organic crystals are assembledvia weaker and less directional noncovalent forces in comparisonwith covalent and coordination frameworks. This can be anadvantage or a disadvantage, depending on the context. Forexample, we have exploited the ＆soft＊5nature of porous molecularcrystals in the preparation of materials with ＆on/o?＊porosityswitching behavior.31Such structural ?exibility, however, mightalso prove undesirable in other cases and lead to irreversible lossof porosity. Moreover, even with the prospect of methods forpredicting molecular crystal structures,33,36the modular andpredictable assembly of multicomponent porous organic crystalsassembled via noncovalent forces remains a major challenge.Hence, to achieve programmed assembly in porous molecularcrystals, as demonstrated in isoreticular MOFs,37it is desirable touse the established tools of crystal engineering and supramole-cular chemistry to direct molecular assembly.38For example,Received: July 1, 2011ABSTRACT: Control over pore size, shape, and connectivity in synthetic porousmaterials is important in applications su ch as separation, storage, and catalysis.",surface area
"Typically, porosity is either ＆intrinsic ＊(within the molecules) or ＆extrinsic ＊(betweenthe molecules) 〞but not both. We report a supramolecular approach to the assemblyof porous organic cages which involves bulky di recting groups that frustrate the crystalpacking. This generates, in a synthetically designed fashion, additional ＆extrinsic ＊porosity between the intrinsically porous cage units. One of the molecular crystalsexhibits an apparent Brunauer /C0Emmett/C0Teller surface area of 854 m2g/C01,w h i c hi shigher than that of unfunctionalized ca ges of the same dimensions. Moreover,connectivity between pores, and hence guest uptakes, can be modulated by theintroduction of halogen bonding motifs in the cage modules. This suggests a broaderapproach to the supramolecular engineering o f porosity in molecular organic crystals.",surface area
"Nitrogen and hydrogen sorption isotherms were collected at 77 K; carbon dioxide adsorption isotherms at 273 K. The derived Langmuir surface areafrom the adsorption isotherm for CC9 (R3),CC9 (P3) and CC10 is 575 m2g/C01(SA BET= 501 m2g/C01), 952 m2g/C01(SA BET= 854 m2g/C01) and 533 m2g/C01(SA BET= 460 m2g/C01), respectively. Comparison of micropore size distributions for CC9 (R3) ()),CC9 (P3) (0), and CC10 (O) as calculatedusing nonlocal density functional theory (D).",surface area
"The desolvated molecular solids for CC9 (both polymorphs)andCC10 adsorb large quantities of gases. The Langmuir surfaceareas calculated from the Type I nitrogen sorption isothermswere 952 m2g/C01(SA BET= 854 m2g/C01) for CC9 (P3), 575 m2g/C01(SA BET= 501 m2g/C01) for CC9 (R3), and 533 m2g/C01(SA BET= 460 m2g/C01)f o r CC10 (Figure 5). Pore size distribu-tions calculated by nonlocal density functional theory from theadsorption branches show two main peaks in the microporeregion for each of these materials. The set of smaller pore sizes iscomparable with the static diameters of the windows of indivi-dual cage molecules of approximately 6 ?. All materials werereanalyzed after gas-sorption analysis by powder X-ray di ?rac-tion, and the obtained data was re ?ned against the crystalstructures of the desolvated materials to ensure that no chemi-cal decomposition or permanent structural rearrangement hadaccompanied the degassing or sorption processes. The nitrogenuptake at 77 K for both CC9 (R3) and CC10 amounts to7.5 mmol g/C01, while the P3 polymorph of CC9 adsorbs almosttwice as much gas (14.3 mmol g/C01). Both of the CC9 poly-morphs show classical Type I nitrogen sorption behavior, whilethe isotherm for CC10 is hysteretic almost over the entirepressure range. Similarly, CC9 (R3) and CC10 absorb 3.5 mmolg/C01(0.70 wt %) and 3.6 mmol g/C01(0.73 wt %) of hydrogen at77 K, while CC9 (P3) shows a larger uptake of 4.8 mmol g/C01(0.96 wt %). At higher temperatures (273 K), the three cagestructures adsorb more similar quantities of CO 2: 1.9 mmol g/C01forCC9 (R3), 2.0 mmol g/C01forCC9 (P3), and 1.6 mmol g/C01forCC10 . To put these results into perspective, the crystallineporous solid CC9 (P3) has a higher apparent surface area andadsorbs more N 2than any of the comparably sized cages that wereported initially,30although it is surpassed by two larger cagesreported recently, one by Mastalerz32and one by our own group.33As such, our strategy of producing additional, extrinsic pore volumevia the introduction of bulkier vertices is successful, at least for CC9(P3), as evidenced both by crystallography and gas sorptionanalysis. It should be noted here that gas sorption in solids suchas this cannot always be justi ?ed by crystal structures alone. Forexample, crystalline defects and surface barriers may in ?uencesorption, and these are not captured by X-ray crystallography.54,55Moreover, any amorphized impurities, which might be ＆invisible ＊toX-ray methods, could contribute to, rather than reduce, the porevolume in these solids.56As outlined above, only a minor rotation of the relevant arylgroups about a C /C0C bond is ＆gating ＊the pore connectivitybetween the intrinsic and extrinsic porosity in CC9. Thus,it is possible that low-energy cooperative dynamic processesmay occur at more elevated temperatures involving transientrotation of these groups, perhaps explaining the smaller di ?er-ence in CO 2sorption observed between the two CC9 poly-morphs (Figure 5).30,57＊CONCLUSIONSTo conclude, the vertex functionality in these new cageswas chosen to enhance porosity with respect to our previousmaterials30by creating additional, extrinsic porosity to augmentthe intrinsic porosity within the cages. For the P3 polymorph ofCC9, which can be crystallized reproducibly from chloroform,this strategy has succeeded. We have therefore demonstrated apathway toward rational, synthetic design of additional extrinsicporosity within this class of intrinsically porous organic cagemolecules. The vertex groups in CC9 andCC10 were chosen todirect molecular assembly in ways that are familiar in the ?elds ofcrystal engineering and supramolecular chemistry. The porousmolecular crystals obtained show exceptionally high gas uptakeswithin this class of material resulting from a combination ofintrinsic and extrinsic pore volumes. These observations raise thequestion of how we might enhance porosity further in suchmaterials. One design principle would be to develop cage tectonsthat show anisotropic ordering to minimize the potential surfacearea in each molecule that is lost in the form of intermolecularcontacts. That is, we propose to search for tectons that formporous solids comprising, as nearly as possible, ＆point contacts ＊between molecules such that the guest-accessible surface ismaximized. In this respect, hydrogen bonding at ＆sticky ＊func-tionalized vertices is a promising tool.",surface area

"Cages CC9 andCC10 were synthesized by cycloimination of1,3,5-triformylbenzene with ( R,R)-1,2-diphenylethylenediamineand ( R,R)-1,2-bis(4- ?uorophenyl)ethane-1,2-diamine, respec-tively, in dichloromethane using tri ?uoroacetic acid as a catalyst(Figure 1). Under these reaction conditions, cage formationcompetes with a Diaza-Cope rearrangement of the same typeused commonly to synthesize vicinal diamines.39As such, theproduction of the desired [4 + 6] imine cage is challenging, andindeed, a previous study reported that the ( R,R)-1,2-dipheny-lethylenediamine cycloimination reaction does not occur.40Thecompeting Diaza-Cope reaction requires a chair-shaped geome-try to yield the undesirable rearranged side-product (Figure S1,Supporting Information (SI)). The key to producing these cagesin viable yields was to slow down the rate of this rearrangementby cooling the reaction and, for CC10 , to remove the condensa-tion byproduct (water) using drying agents. A detailed account ofthe experimental methods is provided in the SI. After someoptimization, CC9 (1706 g mol/C01) and CC10 (1922 g mol/C01)could be obtained in satisfactory yields of 35% and 37%, respec-tively, which is on a par with the initial, nonoptimized yields re-ported for our ?rst generation of porous cage molecules.",topology

"Porous materials are important in a wide range of applications including molecular separations and catalysis. We demonstratethat covalently bonded organic cages can assemble into crystalline microporous materials. The porosity is prefabricatedand intrinsic to the molecular cage structure, as opposed to being formed by non-covalent self-assembly of non-poroussub-units. The three-dimensional connectivity between the cage windows is controlled by varying the chemical functionalitysuch that either non-porous or permanently porous assemblies can be produced. Surface areas and gas uptakes for the latterexceed comparable molecular solids. One of the cages can be converted by recrystallization to produce either porous ornon-porous polymorphs with apparent Brunauer藩Emmett藩Teller surface areas of 550 and 23 m2g1, respectively.

"The molecular nature of these organic cages permits solutionprocessing into a variety of forms. For example, we have foundthat 1, which is formally non-porous as synthesized from ethylacetate ( SABETD24 m2g1), can be recrystallized from a mixtureof dichloromethane and o-xylene to form a permanently porouspolymorph ( SABETD550 m2g1;Fig.6). Le Bail fitting of powderX-ray diffraction data obtained after desolvation of this polymorphsuggests a similar packing mode to that observed for cage2but with reduced symmetry (Supplementary Fig. S39).

"The overall geometry of the proposed prismatic structurewas confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis. Single crystalswere obtained from a solution of 6in a 1:1:4 mixture ofdichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and hexane. X-ray diffractionanalysis showed that 6had the expected trigonal-prismaticstructure, with six amine bonds and a large central cavity(Figure 1). The two trigonal panels are twisted about 228withrespect to each other; thus, the phenyl arms are not eclipsedbut rotated toward a staggered geometry to minimize stericinteractions. The distance between the top and bottom panelsin this prism structure is about 5.6 /C138, and the diameter at thewidest point is 2.4 nm. To our knowledge, these dimensionsdetermined by X-ray crystallography place compound 6among the largest prismatic molecules constructed from[*] Dr. Y . Jin, Prof. Dr. W.

"Results and DiscussionSynthesis of cage compounds : The [4 +6] cage compounds3a每eof this series were synthesized by a twelve-fold con-densation reaction of salicyldialdehydes 2a每eand triamine 1(Scheme 2). Salicyldialdehyde 2bwas synthesized by amethod by Feringa et al.,[29]and salicyldialdehydes 2c每ewere synthesized by a two-fold Duff formylation of the cor-responding 4-substituted phenols ( 4c每e)[30]with hexameth-ACHTUNGTRENNUNGylenetetramine (HMTA) and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), ac-cording to a procedure of Svenstrup et al. (Scheme 3).[31]Be-sides the desired salicyldialdehydes 2c每e, substantialamounts of the corresponding monosalicylaldehydes 5a每e[32]were obtained, which were separated by column chromatog-raphy. In contrast to the synthesis of cage compound 3art,b yusing triamine 1with the commercial available salicyldialde-hyde 2a,[25]it turned out that for the synthesis of cage com-pounds 3a每ewith the salicylaldehydes 2a每e, synthesized inour laboratory, a catalytic amount (2 mol%) of trifluoroace-tic acid accelerates the reaction. By the addition of 2 mol%TFA, cage compound 3artwas synthesized in 60% yieldfrom salicylaldehyde 2awith 1, precipitating as orange solidfrom THF at room temperature.[25]In the reaction of salicyl-dialdehyde 2bwith 1, we were not able to separate the cor-responding cage compound 3bfrom reaction intermediates,although the formation of the desired product can be detect-ed by a basis peak at m/z1882 in the MALDI-TOF MS ofthe crude product (see Figure S14 in the Supporting Infor-mation), suggesting that precipitated reaction intermediatesare already very insoluble. Even at reflux temperature andhigh dilution, the reaction did not run to completion. Ac-cordingly, under the same conditions, 2cand1were reactedto cage compound 3crt, which precipitates from the reactionmedium and was isolated in 71% yield. For the reactions ofsalicyldialdehyde 2dand 2e, with bulkier substituents, wedeveloped another method, because the products ( 3dandScheme 2.

By means of sorption of nitrogen gas,the Langmuir surface area[12]for TPP was determined as240 m2g/C01. TPP adsorbs various gases, for example, 4 wt%CO2at 800 mbar and 298 K.[11]The hexagonal channelsfound in the crystals of TPP is a typical example for extrin-sic porosity, which means that pores exist only among themolecules, but in the molecules themselves there are no per-sistent voids. Since the reinvestigation of TPP by Sozzaniet al.,[11,13]numerous new compounds with permanent ex-trinsically porosities were described in literature.[14]For in-stance, it was found that different dipeptides form tubularstructures with various channel diameters in the crystallinestate.",surface area
"[16]They identified 3,3 ＊,4,4＊-tetra(trime-thylsilylethynyl)biphenyl (TTEB) as a potential porous ma-terial and investigated the compounds gas-sorption proper-ties. Indeed, TTEB has a Brunauer每Emmett每Teller (BET)surface area of 278 m2g/C01and adsorbs 0.8 wt% of hydrogengas at 77 K and 10 bar.[16]Another type of porosity, intrinsicporosity, is observed for compounds which contain definedcavities or voids in the molecules themselves, such as in cu-curbiturils and calixarenes. Investigations showed that intheir crystalline states accessible pores exist for gas adsorp-tion.",surface area
"[17]Via dynamic formation of covalent bonds, shape-per-sistent organic cage molecules[18]are accessible in reasonableyields from readily available precursors. It was discoveredrecently, that some of them are permanent porous with highsurface areas of up to 1377 m2g/C01and selective gas-sorptionproperties. One example is the so-called Noria from Nishi-kubo et al.,[19]which was reinvestigated by Atwood and co-workers.[20]Unlike the above-mentioned materials, this com-pound does have not to be crystalline to adsorb reasonableamounts of gases: The amorphous material has a BET sur-face area of 350 m2g/C01, a pore volume of 0.13 cm3g/C01and se-lectively takes up CO2(2.5 mmolg/C01at 30 bar and 298 K)preferably to N2. Cooper et al. examined shape-persistent[4+6] cage molecules, which are accessible by Schiff basecondensation of four diamine molecules and three moleculesof 1,3,5-triformyl benzene.",surface area
"[21,6]Depending on the peripher-ies, the cage molecules assembled differently in the solidstate, having certain pore shapes and sizes. These cage mole-cules showed BET surface areas of up to 1333 m2g/C01andgas selectivities for CO2over methane.[6]Additionally, thepores could be switched ※on每off§ by crystallizing the com-pounds from different solvents.",surface area
"[22]In a similar fashion,Zhang et al. reported the synthesis of [2 +3] cage com-pounds, which selectively adsorbed CO2(up to 0.84 wt%)over N2.[23a,b]This is also the case for a [2 +3] propeller cagecompound described by Cooper et al., absorbing CO2(3.96wt% at 1.2 bar and 300 K) selectively over N2.[23c]Very re-cently, we described the synthesis of an adamantoid endo -functionalized [4 +6] cage compound 3aby a one-pot iminecondensation reaction of triptycene triamine 1[24]and thecommercially available salicyldialdehyde 2a(Scheme 1).[25]The compound showed an extraordinary high surface areaof 1377 m2g/C01, measured by nitrogen sorption at 77.35 K.[26]This is to the best of our knowledge the highest valueamong porous materials, consisting of discrete molecules, in-cluding metal-organic polyhedra (MOPs).",surface area

"[26]Thecages themselves self-assemble via p每pinteraction of the ar-omatic subunits. In contrast to the crystal structure of thetert-butyl substituted cage compound 3a,[26]four differenttypes of relative arrangements of the phenolic subunits canbe distinguished (see Figures S82每S87 in the Supporting In-formation). The cages form large 3D porous networks,which are filled with THF molecules. These THF moleculescan be used as probe to image the three-dimensional pore-structure (see Figure 5).Gas-sorption and pore-size analysis : Recently, we reportedfor the material of cage compound 3arta BET surface areaof 1377 m2g/C01, a Langmuir surface area of 1566 m2g/C01and amicropore volume of 0.42 cm3g/C01.[26]Cage compounds 3a每3e, synthesized by various conditions, were analyzed by ad-sorption of nitrogen gas to determine the BET surface areasand pore size distributions. The objective of the investiga-tions is to gain insight to which degree the molecular struc-ture of the cage molecules influences the formation of gasaccessible pores in the corresponding material. Before gas-sorption measurements, the stabilities of the compoundswere investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Allas-synthesized and dried cage compounds 3a每eshowed noweight loss up to 4008C (see Figure S35). The crystalline,air-dried samples show a sharp step upon heating to 200 8C,which corresponds to the removal of enclathrated solventmolecules from the pores. All samples were treated at2008C and 6/C14810/C02mbar for 24 h before nitrogen sorptionexperiments were performed at 77.35 K. For the as-synthe-sized cage compounds 3c每ethe nitrogen-sorption isothermsFigure 5. Channel system of crystalline 3c. Depicted is the Connolly sur-face area exclusively of enclathrated THF molecules of a 2/C1482/C1482 unitcell. Probe radii are the van der Waals radii of the atoms of THF.",surface area
"[37]The isotherms show only small hyster-eses which indicate that during gas adsorption/desorptiononly minor rearrangements of the cage scaffolds or thecages themselves in the packing take place. In contrast tothe BET surface area of 1377 m2g/C01reported for cage com-pound 3a,[26]the BET surface area values for all as-synthe-sized cage compounds 3c每eare in the range between 690and 727 m2g/C01(see Table 2, entries 4, 5, 7 and 9), independ-ently whether the substituents in the periphery are less(methyl) or more bulky (triethylmethyl, trityl). Furthermore,the ratios of micropore volumes to the overall pore volumesis between 66 and 76% (calculated by the tplot method)[38]of the total surface area and are all in the same range be-tween Vmicro=0.19 cm3g/C01and 0.23 cm3g/C01andVtotal=0.37 to0.34 cm3g/C01. Although BET surface areas and pore volumesof as-synthesized 3c每eare very similar, the pore size distri-butions derived by NL-DFT methods gave different results.The NL-DFT derived pore size distribution of 3crtis similarto that of 3artwith two maxima pore width at 5 and 11 /C138. Ifthe compound is synthesized at reflux temperature ( 3cD), anadditional maximum at 9 /C138 can be detected, which is alsothe absolute maximum. The material of as-synthesized 3dshows two maxima at 4 and 15 /C138. The NL-DFT pore sizedistribution of as-synthesized material of 3eshows twomaxima at pore width with 7.5 and 12 /C138. In contrast to theamorphous material of the cage compounds, the gas-sorp-tion properties of crystallinematerials is very different (seeFigure 6, top). The crystallinematerial of 3ccrshows analmost ideal type-I isotherm,which is reflected in a high mi-cropore area contribution onthe total surface area (93%)and a pore volume of Vmicro=0.48 cm3g/C01. The BET surfacearea is with 1291 m2g/C01compa-rable to that of 3art, which wasalso synthesized from THF andis crystalline.",surface area
"[26]Microporeanalysis by NL-DFT methodsrevealed three maxima of porewidth at 4, 6 and 8 /C138, withvery narrow pore-size distribu-tions. The crystalline materials3dcrand3ecr, with more bulkysubstituents in the cage periph-ery, resulted in BET surfaceareas of 309 and 22 m2g/C01. Thisis much lower than the surfaceareas of the amorphous materi-al (see Table 2, entries 8 and10). A reasonable explanationfor this is a tighter packing ofthe molecules in the crystallinestate, resulting in a blocking of the pore windows for theaccess of gases. Unfortunately, no high quality single-crystalsfor an X-ray crystal structure analysis to verify this hypothe-sis were obtained to date. For 3dcr, four major maxima canbe calculated at pore width of 7, 14, 18 and 28 /C138. Basically,for3ecrno maxima for pores can be detected by NL-DFTmethods, because of the lack of porosity. It was mentionedbefore, that the as-synthesized material of 3afrom THF ismicrocrystalline but shows a different powder X-ray diffrac-tion (PXRD) pattern than the crystals grown from DMSO,for which we were able to elucidate the structure by gettinga sufficient dataset by X-ray diffraction of a single crystal.",surface area
"[26]This suggests that those two crystalline materials are twodifferent polymorphs.[26]Compound 3awas crystallized fromhot DMSO, giving a sufficient amount of crystalline material3acr(b)for reliable gas-sorption experiments after removal ofenclathrated solvent molecules in vacuum. In comparison tothe microcrystalline as-synthesized material of 3artthe mate-rial of 3acr(b)shows an increasing nitrogen uptake and hencea higher BET surface area of 2071 m2g/C01and a Langmuirsurface area of 2327 m2g/C01. The micropore volume was cal-culated to be Vmicro=0.77 cm3g/C01, which is 91% of the totalmeasured pore volume of Vtotal=0.86 cm3g/C01. Contrary, theas-synthesized material of tert-butyl cage compound 3aDsynthesized under reflux conditions show a lower nitrogenuptake than 3art(see Table 2, entry 2), having a BET surfacearea of 950 m2g/C01.

"ConclusionTo summarize, we successfully synthesized a series of pe-riphery substituted endo -functionalized adamantoid cagecompounds. The substituents are in nature of various stericdemands. We demonstrated that all cage compounds exhibitpermanent porosities with high surface areas and narrowpore-size distributions. The correlations between the molec-ular structures and porosities of the materials were exam-ined in dependence of the peripheral moieties of the cagecompounds. The influence of the bulkiness of the peripheralgroups can be neglected, when the investigated materialsare amorphous: Except 3a, all as-synthesized cage com-pounds ( 3c每e) are amorphous and have very similar BETsurface areas of 700 m2g/C01(3c), 727 m2g/C01(3d) and690 m2g/C01(3d), suggesting that the cavity size of the cagecompounds predominantly dictates the gas-sorption proper-ties of the amorphous material. In their crystalline states,the bulkiness of the peripheral moieties plays a crucial roleon the accessible surface area. For cage compound 3c, withmethyl groups in the periphery, the BET surface area is with1291 m2g/C01almost doubled in comparison to the surfacearea of the amorphous material (729 m2g/C01). With moietiesthat are sterically more demanding, the accessible surfacearea for nitrogen gas at 77.35 K drops from approximately729 to 309 m2g/C01for3d(with 3-ethylpentyl groups) or evenfrom 690 to 22 m2g/C01for3e(with trityl groups). Further-more, various crystalline polymorphs of compound 3adifferin their gas-sorption properties.",surface area

Schneider,[a]Iris M. Oppel,[b]Holger Ott,[c]Lorenz G. Lechner,[d]Hans-Jochen S. Hauswald,[e]Raphael Stoll,[e]and Michael Mastalerz*[a]IntroductionPorous organic materials consisting only of discrete mole-cules[1]have been neglected for a long time, since the sur-face areas, stabilities and functionalities could not competeto the achieved values of 3D polymeric structures such asmetal organic frameworks (also termed coordination poly-mers),[2]covalent organic frameworks (and similar system)[3]or zeolites.[4]Reasons for that are considered as follows: Itwas and still is very difficult to predict packing of small mol-ecules in the crystalline state, especially if the molecules in-teract only by weak supramolecular forces to form porousstructures. Although many improvements have been madein the last decade for the prediction of crystal structures ofrather simple molecules,[5]it is remaining a major challengefor bigger molecules.[6]Many crystalline organic systemswere found containing large void space or pores[7]filled witha number of disordered solvent molecules. Unfortunately,most of the porous organic crystals are not stable and col-lapse during removal of enclathrated solvents from thechannels and voids, which demonstrate that solvent mole-cules interact in a stabilizing way with the pore walls andare crucial for the pore formation. In order to distinguishthe stable porous systems, in which the pores can be emp-tied accompanied by remaining of the overall structure,from those unstable systems, in which it is not possible toremove solvent without collapsing of the porous networkstructure, Barbour defined the stable structures as ※perma-nent porous§.",this paper's author

The clear, colorless solution was stirred at room temperature for 5 每10 min. This solution was then added very slowly to the first solution by pouring gently down the side of the flask to form two layers: a colorless layer on the top and a yellow-green layer at the bottom.

Asbefore, DFT simulations suggest a significant energy gain(19 kJ mol21) in the formation of heterochiral dimers. Again, thecrystal structure can be predicted ab initio . The experimentallyobserved racemic packing is the global energy minimum in the setof predicted crystal structures, and there is close agreement betweenthe predicted and observed structures (Fig. 3d). These calculations alsosuggest a global preference for heterochiral packing modes rather thanhomochiral. A large energetic gain, of 32 kJ mol21, is calculated for the(3-S,3-R) racemic crystal over the most stable predicted homochiralstructure for 3-R. The global-minimum homochiral prediction alsoclosely reproduces the observed structure for 3-R12(Fig. 3c), which,unlike 1, can be obtained from enantiopure solutions because 3-Rdoesnot interconvert with its enantiomer. As for the ( 1-S,3-R) co-crystal,the atom每atom lattice energy calculations were verified using periodicDFT calculations, which resulted in similar calculated energy differ-ences (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 13). An ana-logous set of experimental observations and crystal structurepredictions was obtained for a new cage module, 4-S, which has cyclo-pentane vertices rather than cyclohexane (Fig. 1a). This module formsa quasiracemic co-crystal, ( 4-S,3-R), with SA BET5980 m2g21. In thiscase, the predicted global-energy-minimum crystal structure is anordered version of the most probable site-disordered space-group-F4132 structure, according to powder X-ray data (SupplementaryFigs 12 and 15). By itself, 4-Sdoes not pack in a window-to-windowfashion (Supplementary Fig. 18). Hence, like ( 1-S,3-R), this packingmode is directed by the partner module, 3-R.",surface area

Cooper1Nanoporous molecular frameworks1每7are important in applica-tions such as separation, storage and catalysis. Empirical rules existfor their assembly but it is still challenging to place and segregatefunctionality in three-dimensional porous solids in a predictableway. Indeed, recent studies of mixed crystalline frameworks suggesta preference for the statistical distribution of functionalitiesthroughout the pores7rather than, for example, the functionalgroup localization found in the reactive sites of enzymes8. This isa potential limitation for ＆one-pot＊ chemical syntheses of porousframeworks from simple starting materials. An alternative strategyis to prepare porous solids from synthetically preorganized molecu-lar pores9每15. In principle, functional organic pore modules could becovalently prefabricated and then assembled to produce materialswith specific properties. However, this vision of mix-and-matchassembly is far from being realized, not least because of the chal-lenge in reliably predicting three-dimensional structures formolecular crystals, which lack the strong directional bonding foundin networks. Here we show that highly porous crystalline solids canbe produced by mixing different organic cage modules that self-assemble by means of chiral recognition. The structures of theresulting materials can be predicted computationally16,17, allowingin silico materials design strategies18. The constituent pore modulesare synthesized in high yields on gram scales in a one-step reaction.",this paper's author

Dichloromethane (100 ml) was layered slowly onto solid triformylbenzene (TFB, 5 g, 30.86 mmol) without stirring at room temperature. Trifluoroacetic acid (1 mL) was added directly to this solution as a catalyst for the imine bond formation. Finally, a solution of (R,R)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane (5 g, 44.64 mmol) in dichloromethane (100 mL) was added to this, again without mixing. Over 5 days, all of the solid triformylbenzene was used up and octahedral crystals of 3-R grew on the sides of the glass reaction vessel. The crystalline product was removed by filtration and washed with 95% ethanol / 5% dichloromethane. Yield 6.5 g, 83%. | 1,3,5-Triformylbenzene | Purchased from Manchester Organics, UK | (R,R)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane | None |

The resulting solution was added drop-wise into a stirred solution of 1,3,5-triformylbenzene (648 mg, 4.0 mmol) in DCM (80 mL). The resulting mixture left covered for approximately 7每10 days at 20 ∼C. White, needle-like crystals of cage 4-S were filtered off after 7 days, washed with DCM/methanol (5:95 v/v) mixture, and dried in air. | 1,3,5-Triformylbenzene | Purchased from Manchester Organics, UK | (S,S)-1,2-cyclopentadiamine dihydrochloride | None |
| Cage 5-R                           | None     | CCDC 814042 | The surface area of 5-R (SABET = 1333 m2g-1) exceeds all but one of the porous molecular (non-network) crystals reported so far and is comparable with the first generation of covalent organic frameworks. | Cage 5-R was prepared as follows: an oven-dried round-bottom flask was cooled to room temperature under a dry nitrogen atmosphere. After tri(4-formylphenyl)amine (264 mg, 0.8 mmol) was charged into the flask, dichloromethane (100 mL) was added. To another oven-dried flask, also cooled to room temperature under N2, was added (1R, 2R)-1,2-cyclopentanediamine dihydrochloride (208 mg, 1.2 mmol), methanol (100 mL), and triethylamine (243 mg, 2.4 mmol). The resulting suspension was kept at room temperature for 7 days. A white solid was collected by filtration and washed with DCM (3 ℅ 5 mL) to afford pure cage 5 in 90% yield. | tri(4-formylphenyl)amine | None | (1R, 2R)-1,2-cyclopentanediamine dihydrochloride | None |

To be an idealoctahedron vertex, the vectors connecting aryl-C1 and C4 inopposite aryl units of the cavit and should be orthogonal to eachother (Fig. 1).

"Rigidity of the linker and the cavitand unit is essential forsuccessful octahedron synthesis. For example, reaction of Cbwith two equivalents of either LaorLdgave the entropicallymore favorable [2+4] octaimine hemicarcerands (Table 1).Presumably, adjustment of the central dihedral angle of eachlinker led to formation of [2+4] condensation products withlittle conformational strain. Likewise, the increased ?exibilityof cavitand Ccleads to complex mixtures despite that the C4symmetric conformation of Ccis slightly better suited as anFig. 2 Energy minimized structures of cavitand Cc(A每C) andCb(D每F) with R = CH 3.

 ?  1. Materials and general methods         Reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification, unless otherwise indicated. Tetrahydrofuran is purified by MBRAUN solvent purification systems. Linkers L1, L2, and L3 are prepared as reported in the literature.1,2,3        All microwave reactions were conducted under dry nitrogen in oven-dried glass tube using Discover SP microwave from CEM.        Solid state 13C NMR spectra were taken on Inova 400 spectrometers.        For TGA analyses, samples were run on a TA Instruments Q-500 series thermal gravimetric analyzer with samples held in a platinum pan under nitrogen atmosphere, and a 10 K min-1 ramp rate was used.           Powder X-ray-diffraction (XRD) profiles were obtained with an Inel CPS 120 diffraction system, using monochromated Cu K(alpha) radiation. All XRD spectra were calibrated against silver behenate as a diffraction standard (d100 = 58 ?), so the accuracy is within 1 ? up to the value of the d-spacings. XRD measurements were all performed at ambient temperature (21 ㊣ 1 ∼C).      SEM images were recorded using a JSM-6480LV (LVSEM) at 5.0 kV.  Sample was sputter-coated with gold prior to analysis.  2. Procedures Cage framework F1: To a glass tube were added Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (5 mg, 0.007 mmol), CuI (0.5 mg, 0.002 mmol), a solution of cage 1 (125 mg, 0.038 mmol) and 1,4-diethynylbenzene (14 mg, 0.114 mmol) in THF (2 mL), and piperidine (1 mL). The mixture was degassed by evacuating and refilling with nitrogen three times. The yellow solution was then heated at 100 oC for 1 h using microwave irradiation. The mixture was cooled to 60 oC and the red gel-like material was separated from yellow suspension by decantation. The red-gel was crushed into small pieces, and THF (10 mL) was added. After irradiation at 85 oC with microwave for 10 min, the solid material was filtered. The above procedure was repeated (~6 times) to wash the red-gel-like materials until the solution phase became colorless. The product was dried under high vacuum to obtain a red solid (121 mg, 90 %). Cage framework F2: The above microwave assisted synthetic procedure for framework F1 was followed. Using Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (4.5 mg, 0.006 mmol), CuI (0.4 mg, 0.002 mmol), cage 1 (118 mg, 0.036 mmol), linker L2 (24 mg, 0.107 mmol), THF (2 mL), and piperidine (1 mL), the framework F2 (110 mg, 74 %) was obtained as a red solid.

"By integration of typical regions (around d=9 ppm) atwhich the imine protons resonate, we estimated that thecage compound was formed in approximately 33% of thecollected precipitate, which corresponds to about 14% ofthe whole product library. It is assumed that the higher de-grees of rotational freedom of the two salicylaldehydic unitsconnected by an ethylene bridge causes a higher number ofreasonable possibilities in the virtual combinatorial li-brary,[19]which results in a higher number of mismatched oli-gomeric and polymeric byproducts. From this observation, itis concluded that rigid precursors with directed functionalgroups are beneficial for cage formation.

"[1每9]With specific surface areas of upto 2071 m2g/C01,[5]these new materials complement existingsystems of polymeric porous structures, for example, metal每organic frameworks (MOFs),[10]covalent organic frame-works (COFs), and amorphous porous organic polymers.[11]One method to synthesize organic cage compounds inhigh yields is the reversible formation of multiple iminebonds.[12,13]Nevertheless, only some of those cage com-pounds have been reported to be permanently porous.[14]One of the first examples was introduced by the Coopergroup, who synthesized Td-symmetric cage compounds bycondensation of four molecules of 1,3,5-triformylbenzeneand six molecules of various 1,2-diamines (such cage com-pounds are usually termed [4+6] cages).[3]The Brunauer每Emmett每Teller (BET) surface areas of these first systemswere 624 m2g/C01. These materials could selectively adsorbvarious gases, for example, H2,CO2,o rC H4. Very recently,the same group synthesized a porous [4 +6] cage compoundwith a much higher specific BET surface area (1333 m2g/C01)by enlarging the trialdehyde used.[6]We used a complementary approach to synthesize [4 +6]cage compounds.[15]Triptycene triamine 1[16]was reactedwith salicyldialdehydes to give endo -functionalized adaman-toid cage compounds. These cage compounds show perma-nent porosity in the crystalline phases, with highly accessibleBET surface areas of up to 2071 m2g/C01.[4,5]These cage com-pounds could also selectively adsorb CO2(9.4 wt%) overmethane (0.98 wt%).[4]The above-mentioned unique sys-tems tend to have shape-persistent cavities due to the intrin-sic rigidity of the tetrahedral molecular scaffold.",surface area
"Recently, another type of connection was used to generateporous shape-persistent molecules through an imine conden-sation of trisamines and dialdehydes or trisaldehydes and di-amines, respectively, to give [2+3] cage compounds.[7每9]However, the reported BET surface areas (10 m2g/C01and99 m2g/C01) of these [2 +3] cage compounds are significantlylower than for the [4 +6] cage compounds, though a good se-lectivity for the adsorption of CO2over N2was reported.[7,8]The described [2 +3] cage compounds contain flexible link-ing units within the molecules that allow the molecularstructure of the cage compounds to twist so that the trigonalplanar subunits preferentially interact through p每pstackingand almost close the cavities, which leaves insufficient spaceinside the cage compound interior for gas sorption. Thiseffect might be the reason for the low measured BET sur-face areas.",surface area
"[23]This is typical for micro-porous systems, which do not change their structural consti-tution during gas uptake and release. The adsorbed amountof nitrogen gas was 286 cm3g/C01atP/P0=0.95. The calculatedBET surface area is 744 m2g/C01and the corresponding Lang-muir surface area is 835 m2g/C01. This is, to the best of ourknowledge, the highest surface area for a [2 +3] imine cagecompound and even higher than those reported for most ofthe smaller [4+6] cage compounds.[3]The pore volume(Vpore) is 0.26 cm3g/C01. The contribution of the micropore sur-face area on the total surface area was calculated to be 81%by using the t-plot method. By using NL-DFT methods, thepore-size distribution was found to be very narrow andshowed a maximum at 4.2 /C138.",surface area
"In contrast to cage compound 3a,3bseems to be of lowporosity: A sample of 3btreated as described above ad-sorbed only 25 cm3g/C01N2atP/P0=0.95. The determinedspecific surface area was 30 m2g/C01(BET model) or204 m2g/C01(Langmuir model), which is much lower than forcage compound 3a. From a t-plot analysis we concludedthat this measured surface area is basically not derived frommicropores, but rather from the bulk surface, which indi-cates that the pores are very small and the adsorption of ni-trogen at 77 K is kinetically hindered.",surface area
"[25]Witha stiffer linker unit, we wereable to remove solvent and pre-serve the three-dimensionalpore structure, which resultedin high BET surface areas of744 m2g/C01. This value is signifi-cantly higher than reported forother [2 +3] imine cages and iseven comparable with many ofthe [4+6] cages describedbefore.",surface area

"For a better comparison with other organic cage com-pounds, we investigated both materials for their adsorptionproperties of CO2and methane at 298 K and 1.0 bar (seealso Table 1).[24]The more rigid compound 3aadsorbs62 cm3g/C01CO2at 1.0 bar and 298 K, which corresponds to11.9 wt%. This is significantly higher than described forother [2+3] cage compounds and even higher than reportedfor a bigger endo -functionalized [4 +6] cage compound at273 K (9.4 wt%).[4]In contrast to the adsorption of CO2,only 7.6 cm3g/C01(1.1 wt%) of methane is adsorbed at thesame temperature and pressure.",topology
"To summarize, we demonstrated that exo-functionalizedshape-persistent [2 +3] cage compounds are accessiblethrough the dynamic formation of imine bonds.

"In 2008, we introduced the one-pot synthesis of the endo-functionalized [4+6] cage compound 3by reacting fourmolecules of triamine 1and six molecules of salicyldialdehyde2(Scheme1).[14]What distinguishes this type of cage com-pounds from others, is that it bears six hydroxy groupspointing to the center of the cage cavity. This structural motif is very rare for organic cage compounds, and the functional-ization of the cages interiors through reaction at the hydroxygroups was to date unsuccessful. Herein we present a facilemethod for the post-synthetic modification of the intrinsicvoids in the cage compound, which allows the pore structureof the resulting material to be ※fine-tuned§ in the solid state.",topology

"In this study, we exemplify such a strategy via two novel [4 +4] macrocyclic imine cages. We show that the use ofcomputation, and in particular automated conformer searches,gives much better structural insight than could be gained fromintuition and chemical knowledge alone.↘EXPERIMENTAL SECTIONConformer Searching. Atomistic calculations were performedusing the OPLS all-atom force ?eld,37which was originally para-metrized for organic systems with a focus on conformer energetics,intermolecular energies, and thermodynamic properties. Geometryoptimization was performed using the Polak-Ribiere ConjugateGradient (PRCG) method within MacroModel38and a convergencecriterion of a gradient norm less than 0.05 kJ mol?1??1. Conformersearches were performed using a low-mode39sampling approachwithin MacroModel which follows the low frequency eigenvectors ofthe molecule. We used 10000 search steps with maximum andminimum move distances of 3 and 6 ?. All structures within an energywindow of 50 kJ mol?1of the lowest energy structure were retained,excluding mirror images. We applied a ?nal re ?nement of thestructures and energies by optimizing the resulting molecularstructures with DFT-D3 calculations performed in CP2K40with thePBE functional,41TZVP-MOLOPT basis sets,42GTH-type pseudo-potential,43a plane wave grid cuto ?of 400 Ry, a cubic box of length 50?, and the Grimme-D3 dispersion correction.44This procedure wasapplied to any structure within 20 kJ mol?1of the lowest energyconformer, which we have previously determined to be the maximumerror in the relative energies for the OPLS force ?eld. We have usedthis DFT setup in the past to reliably reproduce the structure andenergetics of porous imine cages in both the solid state16and as singlemolecules and dimer pairs.26We have previously validated theconformer searching approach for other, known molecular iminecages, correctly reproducing molecular conformations as determinedby single crystal X-ray di ?raction structures.28Cage Synthesis.

First, the centre of mass for the molecule was calculated, then the distance between each atom and this centre of mass was calculated. The shortest distance between an atom and the centre of mass was deemed to be the radius of the ㄕvoidㄙ that describes the largest sphere that can be accomodated in the centre of the void. The void volume was then calculated as the volume of a sphere based on this radius.  2	 ?

Single crystals of CC12 are very unstable caused by rapid solvent loss once removed from the solution, and furthermore crack within seconds in protective oils commonly used in the preparation of single crystals. Eventually a polyethylene glycol containing oil was found to sufficiently protect the crystals from decomposition. We assume that polyethylene glycols (probably diethylene glycol) replace the original solvent content (dichloromethane, methanol) in the large 1-D solvent accessible channels, thus preventing a collapse of the 3-D structure and single crystals. When the single crystals are removed from the solvent and dried by keeping in air for a few seconds, such ㄕdesolvated CC12ㄙ remains polycrystalline, but no crystals suitable for single crystal X-ray diffraction could be obtained. Structure solution of the powder data shows a more compact packing and the loss of the solvent accessible channels. The solvent content, given as 4 diethylene glycol molecules, is an approximation based on the structure refinement. The solvent is heavily disordered, not all atoms were located, and we cannot rule out further contributions of other glycols or the original solvent mix. Despite this, we preferred to give a chemically unsound refinement model of the solvent in this case, rather than to utilize popular methods for removing the solvent contribution to the electron density from the measured data.    12	 ?Variable temperature PXRD of CC12  Variable temperature powder X-ray diffraction data (VT-PXRD) were collected with the multi analysing crystal (MAC) detector on the I11 beamline at Diamond Light Source (罣 = 0.825556 ?) and using the Cyberstar hot air blower with a ramp rate of 5 K/min.

"7?10Recently, a number ofthree-dimensional organic cages have been synthesized, whichcan be either nonporous11?13or permanently porous.14?17Organic cage catenanes18have also been prepared using DCCroutes that can form up to 32 imine bonds in a singlereaction.19Some of these organic cages can exhibit surprisinglyhigh surface areas in the solid state,16,20in one case greater than2000 m2g?1,21thus rivaling porous extended frameworks.

All of the imine cagemolecules reported so far by our group have been prepared bythe cycloimidation reaction of trialdehydes with aliphaticdiamines; that is, the underlying aldehyde-to-amine reactionstoichiometry is 2:3. This has allowed the synthesis of [2 +3],28,49[4 + 6],14,16,28,50and [8 + 12] cages.15Self-assemblyreactions with 2:3 stoichiometry are also common for metal ?organic cages.4Di?erent geometrical shapes and topologies canbe accessed by exploring di ?erent reaction stoichiometries, andhere, we explored the synthesis of two new cagelike molecules,CC11 andCC12 , via the cycloimidation reaction of a triaminewith two homologous trialdehydes (Scheme 2), that is, anoverall stoichiometry of 1:1, assuming complete iminecondensation. A tripodal amine, tris(2-aminoethyl)amine(TREN), was used which was previously reported to formsmall [2 + 3] molecular cages when reacted with dialdehydes.51There are many potential [ n+n] combinations that wouldsatisfy a 1:1 stoichiometry, not including the possibility ofcross-linked polyimine formation. However, trial reactions and,in particular, mass spectrometry and1H NMR measurements(Figures S3, S4, S6, and S7 of the Supporting Information)suggested the major product in both of these cycloiminationreactions was a [4 + 4] cage52(observed molar masses forCC11 andCC12 = 1686 and 2599 g mol?1). Given the size,complexity, and probable conformational ?exibility of thesemolecules, it is hard to make intuitive predictions as to theirmost likely 3D structures, although the approximately trigonaltriarylamine node would seem to preclude the idealized ↗cube ∫structure to which these [4 + 4] cages are topologicallyequivalent (Scheme 3).",topology
"Structural models for the two new imine cages, CC11 andCC12 , were constructed manually, assuming an underlying [4 +4] topology as shown in Scheme 3. Immediately upongeometry optimization, the conformation of both moleculesbecame tetrapodal in nature, with the tertiary amine nitrogensof the TREN linker forming the four apexes of the macrocyclic↗tetrapods ∫. This suggests, in the gas phase at least, where nosolvent is included, that no energetic barriers exist to preventthe ↗collapse ∫of the in ?ated cage. To explore whether therewere alternative conformations, perhaps possessing an internalvoid, we then performed extensive conformer searching to ?ndlow energy conformers for each of the two molecules.",topology
"The results from the OPLS energy-ranked conformer searchshowed that all low energy conformations of these cagestructures were broadly tetrapodal in nature, as shown in Figure1 by an overlay of all conformations found within 50 kJ mol?1of the global minimum (147 conformations for CC11 and 266conformations for CC12 , excluding mirror images). Thedi?erences between these conformations involve smallrotations about the phenyl rings on the tetrapod ↗arms ∫androtations about the C arene?Carene?Cimine?Nimine bond. TheseScheme 3.

In keeping with this,CC12 exhibits disorder in the rotation of the phenyl rings inthe single crystal structure of its solvate.",topology
"Crystal Structure Determination. Initially, all attempts atisolating crystalline forms of CC11 failed, whether this wasdone by slow evaporation, by slow precipitation, or by carefulsolvent exchange. In all cases, the material underwent a rapidcolor change upon removal from the mother liquor and becameirreversibly insoluble, suggesting that the material rapidlypolymerizes upon spontaneous desolvation. We eventuallysucceeded in growing single crystals of the [4 + 4] adductsdirectly by carrying out the reactions in pure methanol, butthese crystals were also found to degrade rapidly upon removalfrom the reaction solvent. The colorless crystals were ?nallystabilized by encapsulating them in per ?uoropolyether oil priorto removal from the reaction solvent, and we obtained singlecrystal X-ray data at 100 K for the solvate of CC11 (Figure 2,left).",topology
"13,17,20Theencapsulated crystals degraded within the protective oil coatingupon desolvation at ambient temperature. The cage moleculesare broadly tetrapodal in shape, in agreement with theconformer predictions, with the TREN moiety forming thecap at the end of each of the arms of the tetrapod. To ourknowledge, this is the ?rst example of a [4 + 4] reactionbetween a trialdehyde and a triamine and the ?rst example of amacrocyclic organic ↗tetrapod ∫.",topology
"In contrast to CC11 , we were able to crystallize CC12 byslightly altering the ratio of the dichloromethane to methanol inthe reaction mixture. Single crystals of CC12 were unstable todesolvation and were observed to transform to a ?ne but stillpolycrystalline yellow powder when removed from the reactionmixture. No crystals of air-dried CC12 could be isolated thatwere suitable for single crystal X-ray di ?raction. Uniquely, apolyethylene glycol (PEG) oil was found, unlike all the otherprotective ?uids investigated, to protect the CC12 crystals fromdecomposition. The [4 + 4] cages were again found to betetrapodal in shape, with each of the four arms capped by theTREN moiety. The unit cell was identi ?ed as monoclinic withspace group P2/n. We believe that the PEG oil, and possiblythe diethylene glycol component in that oil, replaces theoriginal reaction solvents (dichloromethane and methanol) inthe large, one-dimensional (1D) solvent-accessible channels inthe crystals (Figure 3), thus preventing degradation of thestructure. For example, the PEG-containing crystal was slowly(over several hours) heated to 350 K; at about 275 K, it beganto show some signs of decomposition, but no furtherdeterioration was observed afterward. The crystal was thenleft at 350 K for approximately one hour, after which it wascooled to 100 K to obtain a data set of the partially desolvatedmaterial. This revealed that the dichloromethane moleculeswere removed from the original structure, while the channelcontent, the PEG oil, still remained.",topology
Nonencapsulated crystals of CC12 that were removed fromthe reaction solvent and exposed to air for a few seconds rapidlycracked but were found by powder X-ray di ?raction (PXRD) toremain polycrystalline. Variable temperature PXRD of the air-dried microcrystalline powder held in an unsealed glasscapillary was used to monitor the change in di ?raction uponFigure 1.

"We next examined whether alternative shapes, such as adistorted cube, might be found to lie higher in energy and,hence, be accessible by templating, using an appropriate solventor template. To do this, the conformer search was repeatedwith larger maximum moves allowed (up to 20 ?), and allstructures (26233 in total) lying within 1000 kJ mol?1of theglobal minimum were retained. Automated analysis of the sizeof the internal void for these structures showed that allstructures in this large energy window maintain a ↗collapsed ∫tetrapodal conformation, with a very small internal void (up to7?3) compared to the much larger void (>2000 ?3) that wouldbe expected for an expanded, shape-persistent [4 + 4] ↗porous ∫cage. As such, these simulations would suggest, a priori, that (i)this [4 + 4] combination is strongly predisposed to form atetrapodal cage, irrespective of solvent, and (ii) thiscombination of building blocks has little promise for theconstruction of shape-persistent cages with large, internalcavities.",topology
"↘DISCUSSIONThis study shows that systematic conformer searching canaccurately predict the low-energy 3D structures of large organiccages that have signi ?cant conformational ?exibility. We believethat these calculations are useful in a predictive sense becausethe time required for the conformer searches (<24 h on a singlecore) is signi ?cantly shorter than the laboratory time requiredfor preparation, crystallization, and structure solution formolecules of this type. For example, these particular [4 + 4]combinations are revealed by computation to be poor choicesfor the generation of shape-persistent cages with permanentinternal voids. Clearly, the methods could also be used in thereverse sense to identify combinations of building blocks thatlead to cage structures where a stable, shape-persistent voidrepresents the conformational energy minimum. We thereforesee this method as a useful component in a broader strategy forthein silico design of functional organic solids, as outlined inScheme 1.",topology
"15However, given that our primary interest is in porousorganic crystals, a methodology that predicts the lowest energydesolvated form is of broad utility. Indeed, the type of ↗virtualporosity ∫referred to by Barbour,54which results from deletingguests from a crystal structure, is of less practical interest andwill not be predicted using these gas phase calculations. It isalso known that some macrocyclic cages can form catenanesunder certain conditions, and this methodology would notpredict such structures without signi ?cant extension; indeed,the automated construction of, for example, models for triplyinterpenetrating catenanes18is a signi ?cantly more challengingprospect than the construction of models for discrete,noncatenated cages, where s tarting structures could beapproximated, in the ?rst instance, to Platonic andArchimedean solids.55It is also important to stress that intrinsic porosity in a single,isolated molecule does not ensure porosity in the solid state: forexample, CC1 is intrinsically porous but its most stablepolymorph packs in such a way that these intrinsic voids aredisconnected.14In principle, this too can be addressed viacrystal structure prediction methods, as we already demon-strated for smaller [4 + 6] cages.16↘CONCLUSIONSWe have synthesized two new [4 + 4] imine cages with uniquemacrocyclic ↗tetrapod ∫structures. These cages have little or nointrinsic void volume in the solid state, and this can bepredicted de novo by systematic conformer searches that revealno low-energy structures with a permanent pore. That is,calculations tell us, with good con ?dence, that there is noprospect with these building blocks of forming anything like the↗porous organic cube ∫illustrated in Scheme 3. There isexcellent agreement between the lowest energy predictedstructures and experiment for both [4 + 4] tetrapods, as well asfor a range of [4 + 6] imine cages that we synthesized inprevious studies. Coupled with algorithms that automate theinitial structure generation, this methodology will form a basisin the future for screening large numbers of hypotheticalorganic cages with respect to their potential for intrinsicporosity. Importantly, we believe that computation here ismuch more powerful than simple ↗intuition ∫; in this case, itgives an unambiguous prediction that nonporous tetrapods willbe formed, and that no other conformers are thermodynami-cally competitive. Indeed, the lowest-energy predictedstructures (Figure 7) are remarkably close to thosecharacterized by single crystal X-ray di ?raction. By contrast,chemical intuition alone suggested that an idealized cube(Scheme 3) was unlikely, but it told us little more than that,and these macrocyclic tetrapods were a synthetic surprise. Infact, automated conformer searching readily anticipates theformation of these structures based solely on knowledge of thestructural formula for the molecule.",topology
"(52) A [2 + 2] catenane would also give the same molar masses;however, the relatively simple1H NMR suggested a noncatenatedproduct.",topology
"The approach also has some inherent limitations: forexample, the calculations are performed in the gas phase andwill not therefore take account of crystal-packing forces,although this could be incorporated in a subsequent crystalstructure prediction step for molecules that provoke prelimi-nary interest. Likewise, while tetrapods CC11 andCC12 donot exhibit ※solvent-in ?ated §structures, it is likely that othermolecules will crystallize as solvates with molecular structuresthat are quite di ?erent from the low-energy, desolvated forms:indeed, we have already observed this for a large [8 + 12] iminecage.",topology

"The dynamic covalent bond, namely the imine bond, allowsthe removal of errors during formation, which leads to a ther-modynamically most stable combination in the majority ofcases.[8a]Does this dynamic nature of the imine bond allowself-sorting in 3D organic cage formation? Indeed it does. Inour recent publication,[14]we were successfully able to showhow the dynamic nature of the imine bond maneuvered theefficient formation of 3D self-sorted architectures. Additionally,we also showed an example of a cage-to-cage transformation,depending on the preference for a partner over another ina complex reaction mixture. Therein, our main focus was tolook into the self-sorting behavior of two randomly selected al-dehydes, irrespective of their geometrical background. Afterhaving such unusual self-sorting behavior in the formation ofpurely covalent cages from randomly chosen components, thequestion that we asked is whether chemists can direct/controlsuch self-sorting. If so, what strategy can help chemists to con-trol the outcome?It is a well-accepted fact that most of the self-sorting sys-tems operate on the basis of difference in geometric shapes/[a]K.

"&Cage CompoundsHydrogen-Bond-Driven Controlled Molecular Marriage in CovalentCagesKoushik Acharyya and Partha Sarathi Mukherjee*[a]Abstract: A supramolecular approach that uses hydrogen-bonding interaction as a driving force to accomplish excep-tional self-sorting in the formation of imine-based covalentorganic cages is discussed. Utilizing the dynamic covalentchemistry approach from three geometrically similar dialde-hydes ( A,B, and D) and the flexible triamine tris(2-amino-ethyl)amine ( X), three new [3 +2] self-assembled nanoscopicorganic cages have been synthesized and fully characterizedby various techniques. When a complex mixture of the di-aldehydes and triamine Xwas subjected to reaction, it wasfound that only dialdehyde B(which has OH groups for H-bonding) reacted to form the corresponding cage B3X2se-lectively. Surprisingly, the same reaction in the absence of al-dehyde Byielded a mixture of products. Theoretical and ex-perimental investigations are in complete agreement thatthe presence of the hydroxyl moiety adjacent to the alde-hyde functionality in Bis responsible for the selective forma-tion of cage B3X2from a complex reaction mixture. Thisspectacular selection was further analyzed by transforminga nonpreferred (non-hydroxy) cage into a preferred (hy-droxy) cage B3X2by treating the former with aldehyde B.",this paper's author

"Results and DiscussionDialdehydes A,B,C, and Dwere selected for the present study(Scheme 1). Among them, Bis furnished with a hydroxylmoiety adjacent to the aldehyde functionality. It is well docu-mented in the literature that a hydroxyl group adjacent ( orthoposition) to an aldehyde/imine functionality is capable of form-ing a stable six-membered ring through HOH﹞﹞﹞OCHO/HOH﹞﹞﹞NCHNin-tramolecular hydrogen bonding.[16, 17]We envisioned that suchsupramolecular interaction can manipulate the fate of a reac-tion in which competing components are present. Before per-forming competitive experiments, all of the dialdehydes wereallowed to react separately with the triamine tris(2-amino-ethyl)amine ( X) in chloroform at room temperature underdilute conditions. The purity and formation of all the newlysynthesized compounds were fully verified on the basis of1Hand13CN M R ,1H每1H COSY , HMQC, FTIR, ESI-HRMS, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. These experimental resultsunambiguously affirmed the formation of [3 +2] imine-basedcages except in the case of C, for which we encountered theformation of insoluble oligomeric or polymeric material. Thiscould be attributed to the steric bulk arising due to the pres-ence of a methoxy group adjacent to the aldehyde functionali-ty, which restricts it to preorganize during the reaction andthus leads to the formation of undesired oligomeric or poly-meric species.",topology
"Quite surprisingly a differentpicture emerged when, in a sepa-rate set of experiments, a mixtureof dialdehydes Band Dwastreated with triamine X. In thiscase no peak corresponding toD3X2was observed rather thancage B3X2. The same story iterat-ed when aldehyde Bwas treatedScheme 1.

A few de-cades later Messmer[19]showed that catalyst is required for theprogress of the reaction as it goes through an ionic intermedi-ate. So the next question that comes to mind is: would suchimine exchange be possible in covalent cages? If so, thenhow? To reach this goal, we have revisited our recent work,[14]and two previously synthesized non-self-sorted cages ( E3Y2and G3X2) have been selected. A solution containing cagesE3Y2and G3X2in CDCl3was stirred at room temperature with-out adding any catalyst (Scheme 6) and the progress of the re-action was monitored by1H NMR spectroscopy (Figure S36 inthe Supporting Information). Investigation throughout the re-action progress suggested slow exchange of partners and theformation of the desired two cages ( E3X2and G3Y2), but unex-pectedly we also observed peaks assigned to aldehydes FandG. This experimental outcome opposes the conventional imineexchange pathway and rather we anticipated that it followsa two-step process: disassembly into aldehydes and aminesfollowed by reassembly by the process of self-sorting. We be-lieve that dissolved water in CDCl3is responsible for the trans-formation. Theoretical calculation (DFT, B3LYP , 6-31G) predictsthat thermodynamically this process is possible, as it gains/C03.84 kcal mol/C01extra stability.",topology
"Solid-state structural examination elucidates that in all casesthree molecules of aldehyde reacted with two molecules ofamine to form [3+2] self-assembled cages in which iminebonds are, as expected, in the preferred trans conformationwith C =N bond lengths in the range of 1.26每1.28 /C138 (seeFigure 6). Aldehyde groups adopted an antiparallel alignmentwith respect to each other during the formation of the desiredcages. In the case of cage B3X2, strong intramolecular H﹞﹞﹞N hy-drogen bonds are found to occur between imine nitrogen andthe hydroxyl groups. This fact is reinforced by the O /C0N distan-ces between hydroxyl groups and the imine nitrogen atoms,which are in the range of 2.52每2.58 /C138. The distance betweentwo central nitrogen atoms of amine Xin cages A3X2and B3X2is/C2517 /C138 whereas, due to lack of ethynyl functionality in alde-hyde D, cage D3X2is slightly smaller in size with a distance of/C2514 /C138. Some of the selected bond lengths and angles arelisted in the Supporting Information (Table S1).",topology

"In conclusion, we have explored the possibility of usingunsymmetrical building units for constructing organic cagesusing dynamic covalent chemistry. Interestingly, the self-selectionof one isomeric cage out of two equally probable isomeric cageswas successfully achieved. Such a process is well supported byvarious spectroscopic techniques. The experimental findingssuggested that the formation of a selective isomer of a [3+2]oligoimine cage from a reaction mixture of an unsymmetricalaldehyde and a flexible amine depends on the shape and size ofthe building aldehyde. Theoretical calculations suggested thatthe energy di?erence between the isomers was the governingfactor in isomer selection, which correlates pretty well with thegeometric shape and size of the reacting aldehyde.",topology

"Abstract: An inherently chiral C3-symmetric triaminotriben-zotriquinacene was condensed in racemic and enantiomeri-cally pure form with a bis(salicylaldehyde) to form [2+3]salicylimine cage compounds. Investigations on the chiral self-sorting revealed that while entropy favors narcissistic self-sorting in solution, selective social self-sorting can be achievedby exploiting the difference in solubility between the homo-chiral and heterochiral cages. Gas sorption measurementsfurther showed that seemingly small structural differences canhave a significant impact on the surface area of microporouscovalent cage compounds.",topology
"As a part of our ongoing research on porous salicyliminecage compounds,[11]we investigated whether chiral self-sorting could be efficiently achieved by using racemic buildingblocks to construct them by DCC. To do so, we studied thecondensation of inherently chiral C3-symmetric triamino-tribenzotriquinacene 1[12]with bis(salicylaldehyde) 2(Scheme 1). The smallest unstrained cage compounds whichcan result from this condensation are the homochiral [2 +3]cage compound 3and the heterochiral [2 +3] cage compound4.",topology

"1In contrast to the irreversibleC藩C bond formation, the reversible imination is an attractivealternative synthetic way for obtaining large symmetric macro-cycles and organic molecular cages (OMCs), using relativelysimple building blocks.2,3The choice of suitable buildingblocks is crucial for the rational planning of the synthesis andfor modeling specific properties of the OMCs. For instance,the use of a tripodal aldehyde, 1,3,5-triformylbenzene, andoptically pure vicinal diamines provides a class of chiral mole-cular [4 + 6] cages characterized by an unusual (for pureorganic compounds) Tsymmetry.",topology
"4Extension of the aldehydestructure leads to cages that di ?er in the amine 藩aldehyde stoi-chiometry and have substantially larger molecular volumes.5This, however, is at the expense of their stability.6The pres-ence of the OH group in the aldehyde skeleton has a profounde?ect on the structure and properties of the synthesizedOMCs. Recently, Lisowski reported the synthesis of [2 + 3] con-densation products in the reaction of 1,3,5-triformylphloro-glucinol with vicinal diamines.",topology
7The observed [2 + 3] over theexpected [4 + 6] selectivity remains opposed to the previouslypostulated ↗odd 藩even ∫rule8and is attributed to the presenceof three OH groups in each aromatic ring.,topology
"The13C CPMAS NMR spectra recorded for cages 5and 7were compared with the13C NMR spectra recorded in CDCl 3for8and 9. All characteristic signals for 5and 7,8and 9appeared in the same spectral regions, regardless of themethod of recording, thereby confirming the postulated struc-tures of the cages (see the ESI ?for details). Owing to the solu-bility in CDCl3we were able to directly compare the13C NMRspectra recorded for the solid and dissolved samples of 6. Bothspectra are in excellent agreement apart from the aromaticregion of the13C and1H NMR spectra of 6. More signals wereobserved than were expected for the D2symmetry, the highestavailable for this particular OMC. Since the [4 + 6] stoichio-metry is not in doubt, the possible reason for the signal multi-plication is the presence of several structures of the samemolecular formula that di ?er in symmetry. Considering thetruncated tetrahedron as a macroscopic representation of themolecular cages 5藩7and systematically decreasing its sym-metry by adding the hydroxyl group (one for each triangularside) we obtained 4-combinations with the repetition of threeelements corresponding to fifteen possible isomers that couldbe characterized by trivial C1(isomers 1 藩5),C2(isomers 6 藩8) orD2(isomer 9, Fig. 2) symmetries.",topology

"Intrigued by these observations, we next investigated thepossible kinetic competition between the formation of COP-Vand COP-VI . It should be noted that the pendant arms (carba-zole or benzene) attached to the central panels (porphyrin orbenzene) can freely rotate in all the monomers tested and arenot preorganized to form a particular product. Since monomersare multitopic and self-reacting, the initial formation of thedimeric intermediate [1+1]Ilikely triggers intramolecular cycli-zation to form macrocyclic intermediates [1+1]IIand further toform cages (Fig. 2). We indeed observed the formation ofa signi 祈cant amount of macrocyclic dimers [1+1]IIin the earlystage of dynamic assembly of COP-V , experimentally supportingthe above pathway.54By contrast, the formation of tetrahedron-shaped COP-VI , in which each monomer unit has to connectwith three other monomers, involves at least one moreScheme 4 (a) General alkylidyne mechanism of alkyne metathesis; (b)head-to-tail or head-to-head arrangement of alkylidynes leading tononproductive or productive pathway in the cage synthesis.",topology
"View Article Onlineintermolecular reaction and three intramolecular cyclizationsteps from the dimeric intermediate [1+1]I. Therefore, theformation of dimeric cages ( e.g.COP-I ,COP-VII ), interlockeddimer complexes ( COP-II ) or a tetramer COP-IV orCOP-V arekinetically preferred. Unless there is a strong thermodynamicdriving force towards COP-VI , its formation could thus belimited. When a benzene ring is used as the planar central piecein a monomer, the pendant third arms on the macrocyclicintermediate [1+1]IIprefer intermolecular cyclization to forma tetramer COP-IV orCOP-V rather than forming a dimer cage,presumably due to the signi 祈cant angle strain built up in thelatter case as discussed previously. The assemblies of buildingblocks vary signi 祈cantly with the choice of connecting chemicalbonds that display di ?erent properties, such as kinetics,directional/non-directional, bond angles, and torsional/rota-tional freedoms. The dynamic assembly of COPs through alkynemetathesis, which is self-reacting, represents a complex systemin which both thermodynamic and kinetic factors have to beconsidered.ConclusionsThe design and syntheses of aryleneethynylene COPs throughdynamic alkyne metathesis cyclooligomeriztion approach andthe e?ect of the size and geometry of the building units on the祈nal outcome of assembly process were systematically investi-gated. Alkyne metathesis is a non-directional exchange reac-tion, which requires regioselective arrangement of ethynylenegroups in order to proceed the productive pathway. As a result,the dynamic assembly through alkyne metathesis is signi 祈-cantly in 祇uenced by the geometrical properties of buildingblocks. Our study indicates the size of building blocks playsa signi 祈cant role in determining the topology of the assemblystructure. Depending on the size of top and bottom panels,dimeric cage, tetrameric cage, or interlocked dimeric cage wereobtained from the monomers with the same face-to-edge angle.",topology

The initial bimolecular reaction to form [1+1]Idimer, followed by a series of subsequent intramolecularcyclizations rather than intermolecular reactions, would bepreferred. Therefore, the formation of tetrahedron-shapedCOPs ( e.g. COP-VI ), which involves more intermolecularmetathesis steps, is kinetically disfavored. However, formationof such a cage structure can be predominant when there isa strong thermodynamic preference. The dynamic assemblythrough non-directional alkyne metathesis is complicated, inwhich both thermodynamic stability and kinetic factors couldplay critical roles in determining the 祈nal product. Althougha general predictable relationship between building blocks andthe assembled structures can be deduced by exploiting analogybetween supramolecular and covalent assembly, accurateassessment of such a relationship still remains challengingconsidering the diversity of dynamic reactions and thecomplexity of dynamic assembly process. We carefully designbuilding blocks based on literature precedents and experience,however, all too o 徇en our planning instead brings somethingsurprising, yet logical.

Previous  report9 on related N-salicylideneanilines indicates that there exists a degree of resonance stabilization capable of overcoming the los s of aromaticity in the phenyl ring, and this can stabilize the keto -enamine form. The stability of the corresponding imine tautomer was estimated by calculating the energy difference between the DFT -optimized structures of the tautomers. In our case, addi tional question arises regarding the experimental preference of the formation of [2+3] systems over the [4+6] cages. The possible reasons for this were sought computationally by comparing the energy of the [4+6] cage 4 with the doubled energy of the [2+3] system 8. The computational setup (DFT functionals, basis sets, pre -optimization with the MM+ force field) was the same as given above. The results are presented and discussed below.",topology,

These results show that, regardless of the presence of D3 dispersion correction and the choice of the functional, the keto -enamine tautomer is strongly preferred for the [2+3] -type compound 8 (in agreement with the experiment) as well as for the putative [ 4+6] cage 4. However, the experimental preference of the [2+3] system 8 over the putative [4+6] structure 4 is reproduced by calculations only for the keto -enamine case, and only when the dispersion correction is taken into account. Even then, the preferen ce is small 每 1.48 or 2.26 kcal/mol, depending on the exchange -correlation functional. The calculated values are, however, differences of total energies, not (free) energies or enthalpies. This might suggest the role of the entropic factor leading to the p reference of the formation of two molecules of 8 over one molecule of 4. These thermodynamic considerations do not rule out possibility of kinetic reason for the preference of the [2+3] over [4+6] systems.",topology,
Discussion of the role of entropic contribution influencing the preferred formation of [2+3] vs.,topology,
[4+6] keto -enamine condensation products and the reversibility of 2+3 keto -enamine formation.,topology,
"There is a remarkable difference in the preferred formation of [2+3] products 8 and 9 in the reaction of 1,3,5 -triformylphloroglucinol with chiral diamines vs. the pref erred formation of [4+6] products in the reaction of 1,3,5 -triformylbenzene and the same diamines. As discussed above, the preference of the [2+3] system 8 over the putative [4+6] structure 4 is reproduced by DFT calculations only for the keto -enamine case  (i.e. for both 4 and 8 existing in this tautomeric form), and only when the dispersion correction is taken into account. Even then, the preference is small 每 1.48 or 2.26 kcal/mol, depending on the exchange -correlation functional. The preference for the 30  smaller 2+3 is unlikely to resu lt from the different angular preferences or strain of the structure for the enol -imine tautomer vs. the keto -enamine tautomer. Actually, the MM+ molecular mechanic s calculation s of structures of 4 and 8 suggest that the putative 4+6 product 4 is energetically more favorable both when enol -imine or keto -enamine tautomeric forms  are compared  (24.3 and 11.2 kcal/mol respectively).",topology,
"It should be noted that the synthesis of the 2+3 products  8, 9 and 10 diffe rs from the synthesis of [4+6] cages based on 1,3,5 -triformylbenzene in the applied reaction conditions; the latter products were obtained at room temperature while the former products were obtained at elevated temperatures under reflux conditions. In gene ral, entropic contribution should favor the larger [4+6] product at lower temperatures and the smaller [2+3] product at higher temperatures.",topology,
"Attempts to obtain the designed [4+6] cage 4 from 3 and 5 at room temperature resulted in complicated mixture of pr oducts. Similar situation was also observed in other cases e.g. in the reaction  of 3 and 7 (Figure S20). In contrast to imine cages, the formation of keto -enamine products is much less reversible. The irreversible nature of the reaction of formation of ket o-enamines derived from the 1,3,5 -triformylphoroglucinol was observed before.1 In the case of reactions of 1,3,5 -triformylbenzene or 1,3,5 -triformylphloroglucinol with diamines such as DACH the difference in reversibility of these reactions is suggested b y the outcome of the reaction. In the case of the former, a single 4+6 imine product is formed in quantitative yield at room temperature after 12 h of mixing.2 In the case of the latter, a mixture of products is formed under similar conditions, while the dominant keto -enamine product is obtained under reflux conditions, although the system is still far from  equilibrium after short 30 min reflux (Figure S19). Similarly, w e have followed the time course of the condensation reaction  of 3 and 7 and found  that t he product  10 is formed  gradually (Figure S20)  and that for the reaction run at room temperature  it is only a minor component in the mixture of various  keto -enamine [n+m] products.  This lack of sufficient reversibility at room temperature prevents ※error c orrection§, which helps the formation of the symmetric thermodynamic product, and mixture of kinetic products is obtained instead .",topology,

The asymmetric unit for ( CC36 S)﹞( CC156 R)﹞6(H 2O), comprises 1/12 cage fragments of CC3 TS and CC15 TR. For CC3 TS, one cyclohexyl was disordered and one CTC bond distance was restrained during refinem ent (DFIX in SHEL). In addition, one C atom was refined with an ISOR restraint. Diffuse el ectron density was tentatively modelled as H2O, these H 2O molecules were refined without H atoms (PLAT306_A LERT_2_B checkCIF alert).

"Nitrogen sorption measurements for CC14 汐at 77 K and1 bar displayed a type I isotherm, as rationalized by thecrystal structure, which mirrors the isotherm shape of CC3汐(Figures 2 m,n and S35). The overall nitrogen uptake andapparent BET surface area for CC14 汐(4.11 mmol g?1,320 m2g?1) are slightly lower than for CC3汐(4.50 mmol g?1,409 m2g?1).38This decrease in speci ?c surface area and gasuptake can be explained by the reduction in pore volumeassociated with the introduction of the methyl groups andthe accompanying increase in molecular mass of the cage: thesealso block o ?some of the pore channels ( Figure 2 j). Thesorption properties of this material with respect to other gases(H2,C O 2, Xe, Kr) followed a similar trend, with slightly loweruptakes than for CC3汐in each case ( Figures S35 and S36 ).",surface area

Hence, precise control of poresize, pore shape, and pore connectivity are needed to tailor them forspeci?c applications. However, for porous molecular crystals, themodi?cation of pore size by adding pore-blocking groups can alsoa?ect crystal packing in an unpredictable way. This precludesstrategies adopted for isoreticular metal ?organic frameworks, whereaddition of a small group, such as a methyl group, does not a ?ect thebasic framework topology. Here, we narrow the pore size of a cagemolecule, CC3, in a systematic way by introducing methyl groups into the cage windows. Computational crystal structureprediction was used to anticipate the packing preferences of two homochiral methylated cages, CC14 -RandCC15 -R, and toassess the structure ?energy landscape of a CC15 -R/CC3-Scocrystal, designed such that both component cages could bedirected to pack with a 3-D, interconnected pore structure. The experimental gas sorption properties of these three cage systemsagree well with physical properties predicted by computational energy ?structure ?function maps.",this paper's author

"↘RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe recently reported a family of chiral cage molecules with atriangular prism shape (the topology can be denoted Tet 33Di6,according to our recently introduced nomenclature),21referredto here as TCC1 [3+6], TCC2 [3+6], and TCC3 [3+6](Figure S1 ).22The smallest cage in this family, TCC1 [3+6], was shapepersistent and found to have an apparent BET surface area(SABET) of 2037 m2g?1as a homochiral crystalline material. Ina subsequent crystallization screen for TCC1[3+6], we observeda new crystal habit for this system. Crystallization of TCC1 [3+6]from a chloroform solution containing ethanol or methanol asan antisolvent a ?orded a mixture of acicular or needle-likecrystals, along with the previously observed crystals ofTCC1[3+6], which are cubes. The needles were found to besingle, although some non-merohedral twinning was observed.",surface area

"↘INTRODUCTIONPorous organic cages (POCs) are discrete, shape-persistentmolecules that possess an intrinsic void, which is accessible viawindows in the cage.1In contrast to extended, bondedframework materials, such as metal ?organic frameworks(MOFs)2and covalent organic frameworks (COFs),3POCsare often soluble in common organic solvents, opening up anumber of processing options and applications.4?6The cagepacking in the solid state has a profound e ?ect on theirproperties, and this can be controlled by the size and shape ofthe cage, the functionality present on the outer molecularsurface, and the conditions under which the cage is isolatedfrom solvent.7,8For example, changing the crystallizationsolvent can result in multiple polymorphs for the same cagemolecule, each possessing di ?erent physical properties.9Theinherent solubility of POCs also opens up the possibility offorming cage cocrystals, which can possess tunable properties10and a ?ord access to unique crystal packings.11Typically, organic cages are synthesized from one or twoprecursors that are able to self-assemble: for example, theimine-based organic cage CC3-Ris synthesized by the reactionof four molecules of 1,3,5-triformylbenzene with six moleculesof (R,R)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine. The precise size and shape ofthe resulting cage is sensitive to the choice of starting materialand the position of the reactive groups with respect to oneanother,7,8and the assembly mode is not always intuitive. Forthis reason, we have developed computational strategies topredict the reaction outcome in silico .12,13For dynamicsystems,14reversible bond formation enables error correctionduring synthesis and can often a ?ord clean formation of thedesired cage. To synthesize cage molecules with di ?erentshapes or topologies, it is common to use precursors withdi?erent geometries.7,8It is relatively rare to see changes in cagegeometry and/or topology by simply changing the reactionconditions for the same starting materials. However, rearrange-ment of imine-based cages in solution to form alternativemolecular species is possible because of the dynamic nature ofthe imine bonds, which can allow equilibration of the reactionmixture in response to external stimuli. Hence, the productdistribution may be a ?ected by changes in the reactionconditions, such as temperatu re, concentration, solventcomposition, the presence of a catalyst, or the presence of atemplating species.15Warmuth demonstrated that solvent canhave a strong in ?uence on the outcome of the cage-formingreaction between tetraformylcavitand and ethylenediamine.16Simply switching the reaction solvent between chloroform,tetrahydrofuran, or dichloromethane prompted the formationof octahedral [6 + 12], tetrahedral [4 + 8], or squareantiprismatic [8 + 16] nanocages, respectively.16,17We alsoobserved that recrystallizing the tetrahedral [4 + 6] cage, CC1,from DCM with o-xylene led to the formation of thethermodynamic triply interlocked [8 + 12] catenated species.18By using TFA as a catalyst, it was possible to form the [8 + 12]catenane directly in the synthesis.18The ability to switch thestoichiometry of the cage products demonstrates that theenergetics of host-solvent interactions can be used to ?ne-tunethe outcome of a particular synthesis; this is similar to theampli ?cation e ?ect observed in dynamic combinatorial receptorlibraries.19,20Here we show that two distinct organic cages,TCC1 [3+6]andTCC1 [6+12], could be synthesized from the sameReceived: October 9, 2017Revised: April 5, 2018Published: April 6, 2018Articlepubs.acs.org/crystal Cite This: Cryst.

"Solvent molecules were extremely disordered in the large void,and it was necessary to use the SQUEEZE routine in PLATONduring re ?nement.24The structural di ?erence betweenTCC1 [3+6] and TCC1 [6+12] can be understood by examiningthe orientation of the biphenyl group with respect to thetriangular shaped window ( Figure 2 ,Table S1 ). In TCC1[3+6],the biphenyl units are aligned and perpendicular to thesewindows ( Figure 2 a), whereas in TCC1 [6+12], they are splayedout in a pyramidal shape to form the larger truncatedtetrahedron cage ( Figure 2 b).In the solvated crystal structure of TCC1[6+12], the cages packalong the c-axis in a window-to-window con ?guration, with thesmaller, triangular window inserted into the larger, hexagonalwindows ( Figure 3 a). These window-to-window interactionsform one dimensional chains throughout the crystal structure,although only along one axis ( Figure 3 b).",topology
"HPLC analysis of a TCC1 crystallization mixture, whichcontained both crystal habits, showed the presence of two mainpeaks, one of which showed the same retention time as thepure TCC1[3+6]cage ( Figure S6 and S7 ). The new peak, whichhad a longer retention time, was therefore assigned as aTCC1 [6+12] cage based on liquid chromatography massspectrometry (LCMS) ( Figure S8 ). Since crystallizationsstarting with TCC1 [3+6] failed to a ?ord a high conversion toTCC1[6+12], we attempted to optimize the reaction conditionsto favor the formation of the larger cage. The starting point forthe synthetic optimization was the reported procedure for theTCC1 [3+6]synthesis; characterization of this material by NMR,MS, HPLC, PXRD, and SEM gave no indication that theoriginal synthetic procedure a ?orded any TCC1 [6+12].",topology
"Twenty reactions designed to evaluate the e ?ects oftemperature, concentration, stoichiometry, and solvent compo-sition were performed in parallel ( Table S2 ). Although theoriginal synthetic procedure was performed in dichloro-methane,22we selected CHCl 3as the primary solvent becausethe original crystallization study that a ?orded TCC1[6+12] usedCHCl 3. The reactions were monitored by HPLC, whichshowed that in addition to the peaks corresponding toTCC1 [3+6] and TCC1 [6+12], a third, unidenti ?ed peak wasalso present in most reactions performed in CHCl 3(FigureS9?13).

Growth Des. 2018, 18, 2759 ?27642761There was no substantial increase in the proportion ofTCC1 [6+12] in CHCl 3; because of this, and the thirdunidenti ?ed peak in the HPLC, the reactions were repeatedin DCM ( Table S3 ). HPLC revealed that the use of DCM asthe primary solvent a ?orded better conversion to the large cagewhile suppressing the formation of the unidenti ?ed peak(Figure S14 ?17). There appears to be a general trend that themore polar the cosolvent, the greater the conversion to the bigcage ( Table S4 ). The conditions that most favored formation ofthe large cage were elevated temperatures with no acid catalyst,a slight excess of the diamine reagent (which often improvesreproducibility and overall conversion to the cage product),25and low reaction concentrations around 1 mg mL?1. Our bestconditions (1:1 DCM/MeOH, re ?ux, 5 days, 1 mg/mL, nocatalyst) a ?orded TCC1[6+12] with a peak area of 72% by HPLC(Figures S17 ). By comparison, the original published synthesisforTCC1 [3+6]22used an acid catalyst and a more concentratedreaction mixture, and it was performed at room temperature.Isolation of TCC1[6+12] was attempted using preparative HPLCand antisolvent precipitation, but both proved ine ?ective. Thismight be due to re-equilibration of the mixture when thesolvent composition is changed or decomposition ofTCC1[6+12] upon desolvation 臲we believe that the latter ismore likely because we were unable to fully dissolve thematerial after solutions containing TCC1[6+12] were evaporatedto dryness.To try to rationalize the formation of TCC1 [6+12] ,calculations were performed to compare the relative formationenergies of the [6 + 12] cages with the parent [3 + 6] cages,TCC1?3. To determine the lowest energy conformer for eachTCC1?3[6+12] structure, the molecules were analyzed in the gasphase using high temperature molecular dynamics (MD)combined with the OPLS3 force ?eld.",topology
"26The simulationswere run for 100 ns at 1000 K, with a time step of 1 fs, sampling10000 structures in an NVT ensemble. The simulations wererepeated until no new lower energy conformers were generated.The results showed that TCC1[6+12] partially collapses (A, tealstructure), while TCC2 [6+12] remains shape persistent with anopen internal cavity (B), and TCC3[6+12] collapses completelywith loss of the internal void (C, teal structure) ( Figure 4 ).",topology
"Nonetheless, it was possible to locate higher energy openconformers for both collapsed structures (A and C, graystructures) and to compare their relative energies with theircollapsed equivalents. More thorough energetic and geometricre?nements were carried out with density functional theory(DFT) methods on all structures to understand their relativestability.

Growth Des. 2018, 18, 2759 ?27642762The open conformer of the large cage, TCC1 [6+12], wasfound to be 33 kJ mol?1higher in energy than its partiallycollapsed equivalent; therefore, it can be expected that thismolecule would collapse and lose its internal cavity in theabsence of solvent. The molecule is likely to collapse via avertex-folding mechanism, similar to that postulated for CC7;31TCC1[6+12] contains 12 cyclohexyldiamines, each of whichcould potentially rotate toward the cavity upon desolvation,thus generating disorder in the crystal structure and asubsequent decrease in porosity. The open conformer ofTCC3[6+12] was found to be 96 kJ mol?1higher in energy thanits completely collapsed conformer. Due to the presence ofsolvent in the reaction, these cages will most likely assemble astheir open conformers; hence, we choose to compare theinternal energies of the open TCC1?3[6+12] conformers withthose of the experimental and simulated TCC1 ?3[3+6]conformers.32A set of experimental solvated and desolvated crystalstructures were available for all three TCC1?3[3+6]molecules,as well as a set of manually constructed molecules for which wecarried out a geometry optimization using DFT. For TCC1[3+6],there was little structural di ?erence between these threeconformations and, consequentially, their relative energieswere similar, but this is not the case for TCC2 and TCC3(Figure 5 ). Our gas phase simulations do not include eithersolvent or crystal packing e ?ects; hence, we do not observe the↗swelling ∫that is seen experimentally in the solvated crystalstructures of TCC2[3+6] and TCC3 [3+6]. Both the simulatedTCC1 [3+6]andTCC2 [3+6]structures overlay quite well with thedesolvated molecules, with RMSD values of 0.20 and 0.31 ?,respectively. However, the structure of simulated TCC3[3+6]twists in a way that is not observed in either the desolvated orsolvated crystal structures, and it therefore has much poorerRMSDs of 1.98 ? (desolvated) and 3.76 ? (solvated). Weattribute this to the absence of crystal packing interactions inour molecular simulations.",topology
"We next compared the relative energies of open TCC1?3[6+12] andTCC1?3[3+6](simulated and experimental solvatedand desolvated crystal structures) normalized per [3 + 6]stoichiometric unit (the [6 + 12] cages being exactly twice thesize of the [3 + 6] molecule). For all three systems, thesecalculations suggested preferential formation of the smaller [3 +6] cages22(Figure 5 ). For TCC1 , there is only a relatively smallenergetic di ?erence between the internal relative energy of the[3 + 6] cages (solvated, desolvated, and simulated) and theopen [6 + 12] cage, of 沙10 kJ mol?1per [3 + 6] stoichiometricunit. The energy di ?erence between the open, solvated [6 +12] cage and the [3 + 6] could potentially be overcome bychanges in the reaction conditions, particularly solvent choice.17For TCC2 [6+12], the larger molecule is considerably lessenergetically favorable than TCC2 [3+6] by between 29 and 42kJ mol?1, for the desolvated, solvated, and simulated structures.",topology
"The situation for the TCC3 molecule is more complicatedbecause there is a large variation in relative energies betweenthe di ?erent conformations. If only the desolvated andsimulated conformations are considered, then there is a largepreference for TCC[3+6] to form by 23 and 45 kJ mol?1,respectively. However, the solvated SCXRD conformation forTCC3[3+6] is only 2 kJ mol?1more stable than the openTCC3 [6+12], which we attribute to the signi ?cant strain that isvisible in the solvated TCC3 [3+6] conformation ( Figure 5 ).",topology
"Taken together, these calculated energy di ?erences canrationalize why TCC1 [6+12] was observed experimentallyunder certain conditions whereas the equivalent [6 + 12]analogues of TCC2 [3+6]andTCC3 [3+6]were not.↘CONCLUSIONSA new imine cage was isolated by a solvent mediated re-equilibration of a triangular prismatic [3 + 6] shaped cage to a[6 + 12] truncated tetrahedron shaped cage. Of the three cagesin the TCC series, only TCC1 was found to re-equilibrate inthis way. This was rationalized by molecular modeling, whichalso predicted that the large cage is not shape persistent andwould be expected to partially collapse on desolvation. Whilethe collapsed TCC1[6+12] cage was predicted to be lower inenergy than TCC1 [3+6], the open, solvated TCC1 [6+12] cage waspredicted to be higher in energy. Our inability to cleanly isolateTCC1[6+12] suggests that the di ?erence in energy between thelarge and small cages is small. These ?ndings emphasize thatsubtle changes in crystallization or reaction conditions can havea pronounced e ?ect on the structure of POCs synthesized byreversible bond forming reactions. The results also highlight theimportance of characterizing the reaction products by morethan SCXRD alone.",topology

In order to increase the yield of the [6+12]  cage we screen ed a range of reaction conditions aimed at isolating the large cage directly from synthesis.  The solvents  dichloromethane and chloroform  were ch osen as the primary solvents as the organic cages are generally soluble in these  solvents.  Chloroform was investigated first as the large cage crystallised from a mixture containing chloroform and methanol.",topology

"Therefore, both cage compounds have been investigated by gas sorption. Thermal treatment (120 oC for 3 h) under vacuum led not to a reasonable activation of the pores. In each case, the apparent specific surface area (Brunauer -Emmett -Teller model) never exceeded 11 m2/g (3-Et-Et) or 27 m2/g (3-Et-H) as measured by nitrogen sorption at 77 K. Because the pore -windows of both cages are narrow, we exchanged solvent first with n -pentane at room temperature,[29] sonicated the immersi on for 15 min, before exchanging with liquid ethane at 157 K for 10 min and activated at 40 oC in vacuum. Comparison of PXRD patterns show in both cases that the materials activated with ethane are much more crystalline than in case of thermal activation a nd the sample of cage 3-Et-H show very distinct sharp peaks (see Supporting Information). Additionally, the crystalline character is also confirmed by secondary electron micrographs (see Fig. 1).",surface area
"The activated sample of cage compound 3-Et-Et adsorbed 58 cm3/g N 2 at 77 K. The isotherm can best be described as a mixture of type I (microporous) and type II (non - or macroporous).[30] By NL-DFT, a broad distribution of pores is calculated. The determined specific surface area (BET) is with 71 m2/g larger in comparison to the thermally activated material. The compound adsorbs 0.34 wt% H 2 (at 77K and 1bar), as well as 8.26 wt% CO 2 and 1.14 wt% CH 4 (both at 273 K, 1 bar). For cage 3-Et-H, the gas sorption behavior changed significantly, when activated by this method. The c ompound adsorbs at 77 K 139 cm3/g N 2 and the isotherms are almost of an ideal type I (Fig. 3). The NLDFT pore size distribution show two sharp peaks at 7.0 and 8.2 ?, which is about the same order as the pore diameter determined by SCXRD minus two times th e van -der-Waals radius of carbon.",surface area
"The specific BET surface area is with 443 m2/g much larger than accessible by thermal activation and comparable to smaller cages e.g. from Cooper et al .[11b], but significantly lower than for larger cages.[13, 31 ] Furtherm ore, the material adsorbs 0.93 wt% H 2 (at 77K and 1bar), 13.8 wt% CO 2 and 2.17 wt% CH 4 (both at 273 K, 1 bar). All derived polymer  materials have been investigated by nitrogen sorption at 77 K, turning out to be of low porosity with specific surface areas below 26 m2/g.",surface area
"In conclusion, it was shown that the rotational freedom of C sp2-Csp3-bonds at least in one of the precursors needs to be highly restricted for the formation of [4+4] imine cages with truncated tetrahedral geometry. The geometrical pre -orientation of reacting groups is crucial, because the cage formation is kinetically controlled. The thermodynamic products are less structurally ordered polymers , which are formed as soon as an acid is present. Both cages were investigated by gas sorption. Whereas thermal activation led to more amorphous and less porous materials, mild activa tion by exchange with first n -pentane and then liquid ethane gave significantly higher BET surface areas up to 443 m2/g for cage 3-Et-H and a  high degree of crystallinity was maintained.",surface area

By careful choice of the precursors geometry, the geometry and size of the resulting cage can be accurately designed and indeed a num ber of different geometries and sizes have been realized to date. Despite of this fact, little is known about the precursors conformational rigidity and steric preorganization of reacting functional groups on the outcome of the reaction. Herein, the influe nce of conformational rigidity in the precursors on the formation of a [4+4] imine cage with truncated tetrahedral geometry is discussed.",this paper's author

"Shape -persistent covalent organic cage compounds and capsules are interesting target molecules, mainly because of the ir defined and precisely confined interior space, which can be used to host guest -molecules of different sizes  or for gas sorption .[1] If the host -guest binding occurs selectively, the shape -persistent organic cages can be used e.g. for the molecular separ ation of (gas) mixtures either in the bulk,[2] by embedding the cages  into membranes ,[3] fill stationary columns with them for gas chromatographic purposes,[2a, 4] or 每 more sophisticated 每 to create porous liquids.[5] Thin films of shape -persistent organi c cages have been deposited on quartz crystal microbalances for selective gravimetric sensing.[6],[7] Organic cages have also been used for sensing in solution by selective fluorescence quenching in the presence of explosives.[8]  To efficiently synthesize  shape -persistent organic cages in high yields dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) turned out to be the synthetic method of choice.[1a, 1b]  Cages of various sizes and geometries should be accessible by choosing the right precursors.[9] And indeed a large numb er of geometries and topologies have been realized till date including prisms,[10] tetrahedra,[11] cubes,[2c, 12]  cuboctahedra ,[13] octahedra,[14]  tetrapods[15] and others.[16]  However, the influence of the precursors degree of rigidity and pre-orientation of functional groups to achieve the formation of shape -persistent organic cages is still not much investigated and fully understood.[17] We and others suggested that these precursors need to be well -chosen and sometimes subtle changes leads  to a complete failure of cage synthesis.[18] For instance, Cooper et al. studied the effect of connecting aliphatic tethers of different lengths of diamines in the imine condensation with aromatic trialdehydes.[19] Supported by theoretical calculations, a n even -odd effect was predicted and confirmed in the product mixture, although the overall amount of non -defined by-products was still very high.[19] A similar effect was investigated for cages stabilized by keto -enol tautomerization by the Banerjee group.[20] Mukherjee et al. investigated self -sorting of a four component system based on precursors felxibility and demonstrated that only the cages are formed with at least one rigid component involved.[21] Our group for instance investigated the degree of int rinsic flexibility of  ＆linear＊ bis -salicylaldehydes in the formation of [2+3] imine cages.[10a] In case of the flexible precursor the formation of defined [2+3] cages was significantly lower in yield.",topology

As indicated by the stability tests mentioned above, Cage 9 is not stable against hydrolysis and the surface area decreases from over 500 m2/g to under 30 m2/g when kept under ambient conditions (capped flask). | According to GP1 cage compound 9 was synthesized from diboronic acid 6 (22.4 mg, 135 米mol) in 71% yield (45 mg, 16 米mol) after the reaction was stirred for 16 h. | Hexabromo-4,5,16-trimethoxytriptycene 2a | The isomeric mixture of the trimethoxy triptycenes 1a and 1b (3.44 g, 10.0 mmol) was suspended in CH 2Cl2 (100 mL), bromine (15.5 mL, 300 mmol, 30 eq.) was added dropwise and the resulting mixture stirred for 7 h at room temperature. After cooling to 0 ∼C, an aqueous solution of Na 2S2O6 (20%, 400 mL) was added slowly to the reaction mixture and stirred overnight at room temperature. CH 2Cl2 (200 mL) was added and the biphasic mixture stirred for 10 min. After phase separation, the aqueous layer was extracted with CH 2Cl2 (4x40 mL), and the combined organic layer washed with an aqueous solution of Na 2S2O6 (20%, 2x100 mL) and brine (2x100 mL), and dried over magnesium sulfate. After removal of the solvent under reduced pressure, the obtained isomeric mixture of 2a and 2b (2:1) was separated by column chromatography (SiO 2, petroleum ether / CH 2Cl2, 4:1). First fraction (Rf = 0.36) gave after removal of solvent and drying in vacuum 2.65 g (32%) of 2b as off-white powder. | (2,5-Difluoro-1,4-phenylene)diboronic acid (8) | A solution of 1,4-dibromo-2,5-difluorobenzene S3 (816 mg, 3.00 mmol) and triisopropyl borate (690 米L, 3.00 mmol) in dry THF (3.00 mL) was cooled to ??90 ∼C under argon atmosphere. n-BuLi (2.5 M in hexane, 1.20 mL, 3.00 mmol) was added dropwise and the resulting slurry was diluted with cold THF (3 mL). The mixture was stirred for 1 h at ??90 ∼C and another portion n-BuLi (2.5 M in hexane, 1.2 mL, 3.00 mmol) was added.

Manipulations were performed under a normal laboratory atmosphere unless otherwise noted. The compounds S1,1 S22 and S33were prepared according to literature. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded at ambient temperature using Bruker AVANCE III 400/500 or Agilent DD2 600 spectrometers, with working frequencies of 400/500/600 and 100/125/150 MHz for 1H and 13C, respectively. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm relative to the residual internal non-deuterated solvent signals (CDCl 3: 汛 =7.26 ppm, CDCl 3/CD 3OD: 汛 = 3.33 ppm). High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were measured using a SHIMADZU liquid chromatograph mass spectrometry ion trap time of flight (LCMS-IT-TOF) instrument, or a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). PL spectra were recorded on a RF-5301 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) at 298 K. X-ray crystallographic data were collected on a Bruker D8 Venture diffractometer. 42.

"28,29This could be accomplished bysophisticatedly designing the self-assembly precursors orcontrolling the reaction conditions. Therefore, it would be ofimportance to unravel the relationship between the self-assembly preference and the reaction factors, such asgeometries of the building blocks,30solvent,31reactiontemperature,32,33concentration,34usage of guest template,34etc. Herein, we demonstrate ( Figure 1 ) that condensation ofone of the two pseudo-linear bisaldehyde ligands bearing a?uorene group and a trisamino linkage leads to the formationof a mixture of a pill-shaped and a tetrahedral cage, which areself-assembled in the manner of [2 + 3] and [4 + 6],respectively.

More recently, the Mastalerz31  group and us32 independently reporte d that using steric hindrance to preorganize the conformation of the building blocks can help to increase the yields of self -assembled tetrahedral cages. In the current report , we further studied  the impact of  building block conformation  on the self -assemb ly pathway by condensing  three closely related tri sformyl derivatives  and tris(2 -aminoethyl)amine (TREN, A1).

Effect of precursor stoichiometry on self-assemb ly outcome  In the main text, we have demonstrated that condens ing either La  or Lb  with A1  in 1:1 ratio in CDCl 3 produces the corresponding [4+4] condensation prod ucts, namely La 4A1 4 and  S24  Lb4A1 4 as the major products. We also investigated the se lf(assembly products by using different stoichiometry of the precursors by using 1H NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Generally, La 4A1 4 and Lb4A1 4 were produced as the major products in a very broad range of La :A1  or Lb :A1  ratios. For example, Lb4A1 4 is the major self(assembly product when the Lb :Al ratios vary from 2:1 to 1:4. However, it is notewo rthy that when the amino(to(aldehyde ratio is much smaller or larger t han 1:1, some other self(assembled products might be generated. For example, condensin g a 10:1 mixture of La  and A1  produced a capsule(shaped compound, La 3Al2, whereas a 1:10 mixture of La  and A1  produced a prismatic cage, La 2Al3, as inferred from the 1H NMR spectra and MS studies (cf.",topology
"In the case of Lb  the situation differs. Here, a 10:1 mixture of Lb and A1  produced only a library of oligomeric or polymeric species, leaving  substantial amount of Lb  unreacted; condensing a 1:10 mixture of Lb and A1  yielded the tetrahedral cage Lb4Al4 as the major product, accompanied by the [1+3] product, LbAl 3 (Figure S41). The observation that the prism Lb2Al3 was not produced in the presence of excess A1  is consistent with the conclusion described in the main text, namely that Lb stabilizes CH?羽 interactions in tetrahedron self(assembly while can hardly support 羽?羽 interactions for prism formation.",topology

"IntroductionPorous molecular materials, such as porous organic cages(POCs), are a sub-class of porous materials that lack the3-dimensional extended bonding found in networks such aszeolites, metal 每organic frameworks (MOFs), and covalentorganic frameworks (COFs). POCs are molecules that haveintrinsic porosity as a result of an internal cavity that can beaccessed through multiple windows.1,2In the solid state, thesemolecules can pack together to a ?ord a 1-, 2-, or 3-D porenetwork that passes through the internal cage cavities; the intrin-sic porosity of the cage may be augmented by extrinsic voidslocated between the cages. POCs have shown potential in appli-cations such as chemical separations,3sensing4,5and as porousliquids.6Because of their molecular nature, one can control bothcrystal phase, the degree of crystallinity and, hence, the porosityby post-synthetic processing.7每12This can be done by varying thesolvent, the crystallisation temperature, the mixing rate, or bymodifying the desolvation process. For example, cages can bedirected to form 3-D interconnected pore networks simply bychanging the crystallisation solvent,13or made intentionallyamorphous using techniques such as freeze-drying.7Conventionally, porous materials 〞both molecular solidsand frameworks 〞tend to be synthesised from highly sym-metric precursors to generate crystalline structures. The use ofbuilding blocks with reduced symmetry to construct suchmaterials results in a larger number of possible structuralisomers, and thus a greater phase space of structural possibili-ties. This makes purposeful design based on chemical knowl-edge much more challenging than for more symmetrical pre-cursors. Mukherjee et al. have recently observed a self-selectionprocess between multiple structural isomers when an unsym-metrical ditopic building block was employed for the synthesisof imine cages,14but such processes are very hard to antici-pate. In the area of frameworks, Zhang et al. showed that itwas possible to obtain COFs with heterogeneous pore struc-tures by using a C2vtritopic building block.15These studiessuggest that introducing asymmetric building blocks, or redu-cing the overall symmetry of the building blocks, has thepotential to create increased structural complexity and henceaccess to novel properties. For porous molecular materials,reduced symmetry has the potential to increase porosity of thematerials, by frustrating e ?cient packing, or to dramaticallyimprove solubility.?Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Full high throughputsynthetic and experimental details, gas sorption, TGA, and NMR data, togetherwith computational methodology details, structural and electronic properties forall 36 isomers, structures of all of the 36 DFT optimised isomers, and the amor-phous structure model.

The reduced symmetry of the tritopic building block relative toits topicity meant there were 36 possible structural isomers of the cage. Experimental characterisationsuggests a single isomer with 12 unique imine environments, but techniques such as NMR could not con-clusively identify the isomer. Computational structural and electronic analysis of the possible isomers wasused to identify the most likely candidates, and hence to construct a 3-dimensional model of the amor-phous solid. The rational design of unsymmetrical cages using building blocks with reduced symmetryo?ers new possibilities in controlling the degree of crystallinity, porosity, and solubility, of self-assembledmaterials.",surface area

The N 2and H 2uptake was 13.1 mmol g?1and4.7 mmol g?1, respectively (1 bar, 77 K) (Fig. S33 ?). Thissuggested to us the presence of an intrinsic cavity in the cage,based on our prior experience of amorphous cage solidsformed from more symmetrical cages where the cavity col-lapses to form a non-porous material.",surface area

This further validates that isomer 1is aplausible identity for this cage. For further details and struc-tural properties for the amorphous model of isomer 1, see ESITable S10 and Fig. S44 in section 5.8. ?Intriguingly, when we analysed the cage molecules in theamorphous model, we found that 83% of the potential intrin-sic void volume inside the cages was lost due to interpenetra-tion from neighbouring cages. This was due to the largewindows in isomer 1; as such, the majority of the porosity inthis model comes from extrinsic voids, not from cage cavities.",surface area

Results and discussionThis work started with a computational screen where weassembled 10 000 combinations of tritopic aldehydes and ditopicamines from a subset of the Reaxys database16into [4 + 6] cages.,topology
"View Article Onlineunsymmetrical cage. This precursor also led to predictedshape-persistent cages by in silico combination with di ?erentdiamine partners (3 shape-persistent combinations predictedin total). Of the 84 potential diamine partners selected fromthe Reaxys database, the C2symmetric (1 R,2R)-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine (( R,R)-CHDA) was particularly promising and com-mercially available. This diamine has also been used pre-viously to synthesise a number of POCs, including CC3,formed with the tritopic aldehyde (Fig. 1b),18and TCC1-3 ,formed with tetratopic aldehydes.19A high-throughput (HT) experimental screen of trialdehyde1with 16 diamine partners (see further details in the ESI,section 3 ?), also identified ( R,R)-CHDA (Fig. 1b) as a promisingcage-forming partner, with the formation of a [4 + 6] cage indi-cated by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) (Fig. S5 ?).",topology
"Optimisation and scale-up of the reaction between trialde-hyde 1and ( R,R)-CHDA resulted in the formation of a [4 + 6]cage molecule with 96% mass recovery and 91% (a/a) purity asanalysed by HPLC. Based on our previous experience, theobserved stability of the cage to solvent removal suggested thatthe cage might be shape-persistent, because cages that lackshape-persistence quite often also exhibit some chemicaldecomposition along with collapse of the cage cavity.",topology
"20,21A single peak in the HPLC suggested the formation of a singlecage species (Fig. S12 ?). However, the1H NMR spectra was verycomplex by comparison with spectra usually observed for sym-metrical cages (Fig. 2b, Fig. S45 and S46 ?): for example, the[4 + 6] cage CC3 (Fig. 1b) displays a single chemical shift forall 12 imine protons and a single chemical shift for the 12 aro-matic protons. This complex NMR suggested that the reactionwith trialdehyde 1either forms a mixture of cage isomers, or asingle highly unsymmetrical cage isomer. To aid characteris-ation, further purification was carried out by preparative-HPLCto a?ord the unsymmetrical cage with >98% (a/a) purity.",topology
"Despite the complexity of the1H NMR spectra, which couldsuggest the presence of cage isomers, the integration of thepeaks as whole numbers before and after purificationsuggested instead that a single cage had formed, rather than amixture of species. To further confirm this, di ?usion NMR wasused to determine both the size of the cage in solution and toestablish whether a mixture of cages with varying shapes (andsizes) had formed. The measured solvodynamic diameter ofthe cage was 18.6 ?, which is consistent, by comparison withprevious measurements, with a [4 + 6] cage containing aninternal cavity (Table S11 ?). A single size of cage species wassuggested because all peaks had identical di ?usion co-e?cients, as illustrated by the1H DOSY spectra (Fig. 2d,Table S4 ?).",topology
"Furthermore, there was evidence of connectivity between thesefaces by through-space interactions observed in the 1D-NOEs 每see Fig. S28. ?This suggests the formation of a single [4 + 6]cage that has no symmetry ( C1symmetry).",topology
"20Taking the experimental data as a whole suggests the for-mation of a single, completely unsymmetrical, shape-persist-ent [4 + 6] cage. To our knowledge, this is the first example ofits kind among POCs. The cage was found to be extremelysoluble (>400 mg mL?1in CHCl 3) compared to previouslyreported symmetrical cages (see Fig. S35 ?), for example, CC3has‵3m gm l?1solubility in CHCl 3.24This is presumablybecause of disruption of the lattice packing in this highlyunsymmetrical molecule, and highlights the potential advan-tage to exploring lower symmetry cage molecules.",topology
"Without a single crystal to definitively solve the structure ofthe cage molecule, we again turned to computational model-ing, following the computational pipeline summarised inFig. 3. There are two possible cage topologies, Tri4Di6andTri42Di6,25that would lead to the [4 + 6] molecular mass ionidentified by HRMS ([M + 2H]2+759.9211 g mol?1; Fig. S29 ?).",topology

It is generally assumed that the imine bond is ratherchemically labile allowing a sel f-correction mechanism untilthermodynamic equilibrium is reached, which is often the case ifa cage is formed. However, there are some contradictoryexperimental data to this assumption. To get a deeper insight intothe imine bond dynamics of covalent organic cages, we studied theformation and exchange of both dialdehydes and triamines of twodi?erent [2 + 3] imine cages with the aid of a deuterated dialdehydemolecular building block.",topology
"9Based on experimental data on cage stabilities andformation, possible exchange of molecular building blocks waselaborated and later on studied in more detail:10a thermody-namic, less stable cage was transferred to a more stable one byadding either another triamine or dialdehyde. A similarobservation was made by the Li group.11Cram and Stoddartsuggested an imine exchange of a carcerand by an acid-catalyzedbar-opening/bar-closing mechanism by exchanging diamineunits.12Very recently, Ko ?odziejski et al. presented a verydetailed study of the self-sorting and exchange of aldehydeprecursor units of TREN-based cages.13We and otherresearchers studied chiral self-sorting, which also relies on adynamic interconversion of imine bonds.4g,14Most convincingexperiments to demonstrate the dynamics of the imine bondformation were done by the Li group by investigating theinterconversion of a pillared [2 + 3] cage into a tetrahedral [4 +4] cage under di ?erent conditions. Depending on temperatureor concentration, a clear shift toward one of these two cages wasobserved.",topology
"D e s p i t et h el a r g en u m b e ro fe x a m p l e ss u p p o r t i n gathermodynamically controlled formation of imine cages, thereare also observations made, proposing that imine cages arerather kinetically controlled products. For instance, theformation of a cubic [4 + 4] salicylimine cage was monitoredby time with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of?ight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS).",topology
"driven by precipitation, similar to that for most salicyliminecages described previously.4e,g,16One clear example of akinetically controlled product is the formation of truncatedtetrahedral [4 + 4] imine cages that have been made inacetonitrile.",topology
"17As soon as tri ?uoroacetic acid is added, the cagesdecompose to give an insoluble polymeric material, whichturned out to be a crystalline covalent-organic framework.17Asmentioned above, computational screening of large combinato-rial libraries of possible cages relies on the assumption that theseare thermodynamically favored, and exactly these truncated [4 +4] cages were predicted not to form.",topology
"6bBesides the ↗lost hit ∫ofthe truncated tetrahedral [4 + 4] cages, there are a few moreexamples, where such calculations were not able to explain theexperimentally found preferred product. In this respect, Cooperand co-workers observed the cage enlargement of a [4 + 6] to an[8 + 12] imine cage, despite the theoretical calculated preferencefor the smaller one.",topology
"6cThe same group observed the formation ofopen-pot cages preferably to a social self-sorted mixture of [4 +6] and [4 + 4] imine cages despite the calculatedthermodynamic favor toward the mixture.7Because of all these ↗contradictory ∫?ndings, we wereinterested in investigating the dynamics of the imine bonds oforganic cages in more detail, once these have formed. To excludeany driving forces by electronic di ?erences of the used amines oraldehydes or di ?erent solubility of either reactants, intermedi-ates, or cages, we decided to look at scrambling of [2 + 3] iminecages and their deuterated congeners under di ?erent conditions,which we describe herein.",topology
"The incorporation of the deuterated tert-butyl groups ( tBu-d9) into cage 4-d27 was unambiguously proven by missing thesignal of the tert-butyl protons at 挬= 1.37 ppm in the1H NMRspectrum, which was previously observed for cage 4(seeFigure1). Similar observation was made for the pair 5and5-d27 (herethetert-butyl protons resonate at 1.39 ppm). More important forour studies is the clear di ?erentiation by MALDI-TOF MS. Themolecular isotopic peak for cage 4([M + H]+) appears at m/z=Scheme 1.

"Solvent E ?ect on Cage Formation. As mentioned above,several conditions (di ?erent solvents, presence or absence ofcatalytic amounts of acid) have been reported for the synthesisof cages. For [2 + 3] imine cages of the general structure of 4,typically EtOH, MeOH, CH2Cl2, CHCl3, or acetonitrile arereported.18a,b,d,e,19a,cSince we found for [4 + 4] cages that theseare formed exclusively in acetonitrile without acid, a solventscreening (with and without acid) was done for the cagesynthesis of 4and5to study its in ?uence (see Schemes 2 and3andTables 1 and2for NMR analytics, see the SupportingInformation , Figures S46 ?S49). It is worth mentioning thatalthough all reactions were performed at least twice, we were notinterested in determination of exact yields, but in estimating thenumber of formed cages in solution and in the solid state of aformed precipitate. If a precipitate was formed, it was collectedby?ltration, dried, wei ghed, and analyzed by1HN M Rspectroscopy. The remaining mother liquor was dried, a de ?nedamount of 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene added as internal standard,and investigated by1H NMR spectroscopy to estimate theamount of formed cages by integration of a characteristic protonsignal ( 4:挬= 7.18 ppm, 5:挬= 7.59 ppm) and 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene ( 挬= 7.09 ppm).",topology
"No scrambling was observed in EtOH or MeOH 臲solventsmost often used to synthesize these [2 + 3]-cages. Again, cage 5is di?erent. No scrambling was observed with aldehyde 1-d9,when no acid is present, but scrambling is detected in toluene,MeCN, MeOH, and EtOH with acid. Cage 5is thermodynami-cally favored over cage 4by瞁Geq=?6 kJ/mol. Nevertheless,cage 4was not converted to cage 5upon the addition of TRENwhen the reaction mixture was kept in the solid state 臲oncemore emphasizing how important the solvent and solubility ofcages and intermediates therein are, to allow the system to reachthermodynamic equilibrium.",topology
"To demonstrate the role of kinetics in imine cage chemistry,we were able to convert thermodynamically more stable cage 5to cage 4nearly quantitatively based on the knowledgegenerated herein. If a solution of cage 5in methanol is treatedwith amine 2(20 equiv), cage 4precipitates in pure form and87% yields ( Scheme 9 ).Scheme 7.

Org. Chem. 2020, 85, 13757 ?1377113764↘CONCLUSIONSThis study emphasizes how important the role of solvent forimine cage formation is and that once the cage has formed,under most conditions it does not undergo a dynamic exchangewith an aldehyde of the same solubility and reactivity as the onealready used for the cage-forming reaction. This does notnecessarily mean that it is (but it can be!) the kinetic product,especially when it precipitates out of the reaction mixture as hasalready been stated by De Rycke et al. earlier: ↗The literatureemphasizes the thermodynamic stability of such assemblies[cages] but in precipitation processes one might consider thereaction to be kinetically controlled. ∫18bThis may explain whycomputational screening of thermodynamic data (such as heator energy of formation) of ?nal compounds exclusively can leadto contradictory experimental observations, such as has beenreported in the case of the formation of a (thermodynamicallyunfavored) cage pot7or a (thermodynamically unfavored) larger↗doubled ∫cage.6cAlthough by high throughput screening ofthermodynamic heat of formations of cages, a large number ofinteresting new cage structures were found to form, but purelyrelying on these calculations can lead to the missing of veryinteresting structures, such as the tetrahedral [4 + 4] imine cagesfrom our group,17which have successfully been synthesized andstudied further.18c,20As Jelfs and co-workers recently pointedout,7computations of kinetic pathways of cage formations aremuch more complicated and time-consuming than those forcalculating relative energies of formation but may need to beconsidered in cases where theoretical and experimental data donot give the same picture.Scheme 8.

A conventional synthetic approach for imine-based POCs and COFs usually involves the use oforganic solvents/acid catalysts (such as AcOH or TFA). However, synthesizing and growing POC crystalsand COF crystallites with enhanced crystallinity is not an easy-to-perform process, in which many reac-tion parameters need to be screened. To overcome these problems, we have proposed herein a facileand green synthetic strategy by adopting H2O/organic solvents/MOH (M = Na, K, and Cs) as reactionmedia to produce a series of phenol-based POCs and COFs. X-ray crystallography and molecular simu-lations have been used to con ?rm their structures in addition to NMR, mass and FT-IR spectra, and gassorption experiments reveal their porosity and sorption properties. This new approach provides not onlyan e?cient and alternative route to synthesize highly crystalline POCs and even COFs, but also insightinto the crystallization process of these two kinds of porous materials, especially in the hydrous media.",this paper's author

"Particularly, this method is believed to o ?er an easy ande?cient way to grow single crystals of some POCs and COFson a large scale, which are hard to be obtained using conven-tional methods.Results and discussionSynthesis and characterization of four POC crystalsTo better illustrate our synthetic approach, we have adoptedo-hydroxyaryl arylaldehydes ( 1每3) and 1,3,5-triformylphloroglu-cinol ( Tp) as monomers to construct four POCs and four COFs,respectively. Four POCs were synthesized by the condensationreactions of three o-hydroxyaryl aldehydes ( 1每3) with (1 S,2S)o r(1R,2R)-cyclohexanediamine in [3 + 6], [2 + 4] or [4 + 8] cycloi-mination (Fig. 2). The synthesis was performed in a mixture ofethanol and water in the presence of MOH (M = Na, K, andCs). Firstly, tetraaldehyde and 2 equiv. of KOH were dissolvedin a mixture of EtOH/H2O (in a range of 1 : 1 每3 : 1) and then 2equiv. of (1 S,2S)o r( 1 R,2R)-cyclohexanediamine were added.",topology
"View Article Onlinesingle crystals of NC1-Swere isolated from a mixture ofethanol and water in a yield of 43% (see section S-2 andFig. S27 ?) without any other by-products. Its ESI-MS spectrumshows the [3 + 6] cage structure with a molecular ion peak atm/z= 1364.17 (Fig. S21 ?). Crystallographic analysis shows thatthe [3 + 6] tubular cage of NC1-Scrystallizes in the tetragonalspace group of P43212 (Fig. 2c and Table S-1 ?), which isdi?erent from our previously reported racemic NC1.33Poresize distributions (5.0, 5.7, and 6.5 ?) calculated by non-localdensity functional theory from the Ar sorption analysis of NC1-S(Fig. S40 ?) are consistent with those obtained by their struc-tural measurement (Fig. S32 ?).",topology
"NC2-Rand NC3-Rwere synthesized by a condensation reac-tion between tetraaldehyde 2and (1 R,2R)-cyclohexanediaminein [2 + 4] and [3 + 6] cycloimination in the presence of EtOH/H2O/MOH (M = Na, K, and Cs). They can be directly collectedfrom their respective mother solutions in pure phase by con-trolling the evaporation temperature (see the ESI ?for detailedexperimental methods). NC2-Rwas isolated directly as yellowblock crystals in 35% yield (Fig. S27 ?). It adopts the [2 + 4] con-figuration in which the two tetraaldehyde components arenearly perpendicular to each other and four (1 R,2R)-cyclohexa-nediamine units lie on every corner of the cage (Fig. 2b and c).",topology
"However, no single crystals of NC3-Rsuitable for X-ray crystal-lographic analysis could be obtained. The structure of NC3-Rwas confirmed by the presence of a clear positive [3 + 6] mole-cular ion peak at m/z= 1407.00 in the ESI-MS spectrum(Fig. S23), as well as in the related FT-IR,1H NMR and13CNMR spectra (see the ESI ?), which indicates that the configur-ation of NC3-Rmay be analogous to the configuration of NC1-S(Fig. 2b).",topology
"NC4- Scrystals were obtained in a yield of 30% by a con-densation reaction between tetraaldehyde 3and (1 R,2R)-cyclo-hexanediamine in the presence of EtOH/H 2O/MOH (M = Na,K, and Cs). X-ray structural analysis (Fig. 2) and the ESI-MSspectrum (Fig. S24 ?)o f NC4- Rreveal that it is a [4 + 8]organic cage in the ＆Z＊geometry, similar to a double [2 + 4]cage. Therefore, it can be concluded that subtle alterations ofthe tetraaldehyde precursors could result in totally di ?erentcage configurations. To control the formation of these cagestructures, the design of the tetraaldehydes, in particular theangle between the two adjacent phenyl planes, is very impor-tant. The ideal angles for the construction of the [3 + 6] con-figuration may lie in the range of 116 每180∼. However, theresulting cage topologies not only depend on the angles orchemical functionality of the precursors, but also on multipleparameters such as the solvent e ?ect, temperature, and mole-cular interactions in the system. Additionally, no keto 每enoltautomerism is observed in the structures of four iminecages, in which all compounds adopt the same enol form intheir solid states.Synthesis and characterization of COFsWe also successfully extended our strategy to synthesize fourphenol-based COFs including one new COF ( COF-NJU-1 ) andthree reported 汕-ketoenamine-linked COFs ( TpPa-1 ,TpBD andTpTph ),25,34,35as shown in Fig. 3. The synthetic protocol forCOFs was the same as that for POCs described above, exceptthe organic solvent component (Fig. S33 ?). Taking COF-NJU-1as an example, tetraaldehyde 1and KOH (1 : 2, molar ratio)were dissolved in water to form a clear solution, and an N,N∩-diethylformamide (DEF) solution of benzidine (2 equiv. corres-ponding to tetraaldehyde 1) was added under stirring to a ?orda crystalline red-brown precipitate (73% yield) after 24 h (seethe ESI ?for detailed data). It should be noted that ethanolmay not be a suitable choice of solvent in this case becausethe EtOH/H2O/KOH combination did not result in the for-mation of crystalline COF-NJU-1 . We therefore screened severalorganic solvents including acetonitrile, 1,4-dioxane, N,N∩-di-methylformamide (DMF) and DEF for preparing COF-NJU-1and found that DEF/H 2O/KOH was the optimal combination(Fig. 3a).",topology
"Notice: In our experiments,  [4+8] cage NC4-R was isolated  as block  crystals  (Figure S27) in a yield of ~30% via slow evaporation for several weeks, accompanied  by some amorphous by-products with unknown structures  (Figures S17, S20).  Many attempts to avoid yielding the amorphous solid were not successful, including adjusting the solvent ratios, equiv. of NaOH (KOH) and reaction  temperature. Fortunately, NC4-R  could be easily purified  by water or ether  washing and successfully characterized  by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, FT-IR and PXRD.",topology

"95?97We found that these [2 + 4] dimericcages show considerably high CO2and C2H2capacities withthe range of 19 to 40 cm3g?1and 39 to 52 cm3g?1at roomtemperature (RT) ( Figures S49 ?S52), respectively, which aremuch higher than their calix[4]resorcinarene precursor whoseCO2uptake is 6.5 cm3g?1and C2H2uptake is 5.4 m3g?1at298 K ( Figure S49 ) and also those reported nonporousadaptive molecules have intrinsic cavities.98?101As for the [3 + 6] trimeric triangular prisms and [6 + 12]hexameric octahedrons, N 2adsorption measurements revealthat their isotherm shapes can be described as type I with asmall contribution from type II. Their isotherm curves showrapid uptake of N2gas at low pressure ( P/P0< 0.1), andfurther gradual uptake above P/P0= 0.1. The steep regions ofthe isotherm curves could be attributed to the micropore?lling, while the more gentle regions might be due to the gasadsorption into larger pores created from interparticle voids.Their maximum N2adsorption capacities at P/P0= 0.99 andBET values are listed in Table 2 , the latter of which are higherthan most of the reported POCs ( Figure 4 d).74?76,102?123Notall previously reported covalent organic cages provide gassorption data, which demonstrate permanent porosity in thesolid state; consequently, it is possible that some cages are, infact, porous but their sorption isotherms have not beenmeasured. The BET of CPOC-303 which is up to 2803 m2g?1presents the highest in POCs synthesized by Schi ?-basereactions, and only lower than the cuboctahedron [12 + 8]cage constructed from B ?O bond formation reaction, which isvery easily hydrolyzed and decomposes upon exposure tomoisture, thus limiting its wider applications.

A series of new POCs with dimeric cages withodd?even behaviors, unprecedented trimeric triangular prisms, and thelargest recorded hexameric octahedra have been prepared. These POCsare all constructed from the same tetratopic tetraformylresorcin[4]arenecavitand by simply varying the diamine ligands through Schi ?-basereactions and are fully characterized by X-ray crystallography, gassorption measurements, NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry.The odd ?even e ?ects in the POC conformation changes of the [2 + 4]dimeric cages have been con ?rmed by density functional theorycalculations, which are the ?rst examples of odd ?even e ?ects reportedin the cavitand-based cage system. Moreover, the ※V§shape phenylenediamine linkers are responsible for the novel [3 + 6] triangularprisms. The window size and environment can be easily functionalized by di ?erent groups, providing a promising platform for theconstruction of multivariate POCs. Use of linear phenylenediamines led to record-breakingly large [6 + 12] truncated octahedralcages, the maximum inner cavity diameters and volumes of which could be readily modulated by increasing the spacer length of thephenylenediamine linkers. This work can lead to an understanding of the self-assembly behaviors of POCs and also sheds light onthe rational design of POC materials for practical applications.",topology
"Herein, 11 new POCs with de ?nite crystal structures,showing distinct self-assembly behaviors and structuralcharacteristics, are presented. Speci ?cally, these POCs can bedivided into three di ?erent structure types, the [2 + 4] dimericcages with odd ?even behaviors, unprecedented [3 + 6]trimeric triangular prisms, and [6 + 12] hexameric octahedronswith very large cavities ( Scheme 1 ). They are synthesized witha Schi ?-based reaction by the combination of 4-connectedbowl-shaped tetraformylresorcin-[4]arene (C4RACHO) moi-eties and 2-connected diamine linkers.

"Self-Assembly and X-ray Crystal Structures of [2 + 4]Dimeric Cages. Four new amine-linked POCs, shown inFigure 1 a have been prepared by the Schi ?base reactionbetween C4RACHO and four ?exible alkanediamine analogueswith an increasing number of methylene groups. 1,3-Propane-diamine was used for CPOC-101 , 1,4-butanediamine forCPOC-102 , 1,5-pentanediamine for CPOC-103 , and 1,6-hexanediamine for CPOC-104 . X-ray analysis revealed thatCPOC-101 ,CPOC-102 , and CPOC-104 all crystallize in themonoclinic system with the space group I2/a, P21/n and P21/c, respectively; while CPOC-103 is triclinic with a P-1 spacegroup ( Figure 1 b).CPOC-104 is the ?rst example of cageslinked by such a long ?exible 1,6-diaminohexane residue. Eachcage molecule has one central cavity and four windows. Withthe increasing lengths of the alkanediamine, the volumes forCPOC-101 toCPOC-104 calculated by Voidoo,80?82increased from 358 to 581 ?3. In all of the crystal structures,the cage cavities and interstices all accommodate solventmolecules ( Figures S36 ?S39).

The gauche and eclipsed conformationchanges lead to much closer heights of CPOC-101 andCPOC-102 and of CPOC-103 andCPOC-104 .

"Self-Assembly and X-ray Crystal Structures of [3 + 6]Trimeric Triangular Prisms. In 1991, both the Warmuth andCram groups reported the Schi ?base reaction betweenmethylene-bridged tetraformylresorcin[4]arene cavitands andm-phenylenediamine to produce dimeric cages.84,85These cagestructures were characterized by NMR and mass spectrometry,but were not con ?rmed by X-ray crystal di ?raction. We used anone-bridged C4RACHO cavitand to react with m-phenyl-enediamine. Surprisingly, an unprecedented [3 + 6] trimerictriangular prism ( CPOC-201 ) was obtained ( Figure 2 a,b).",topology
"Speci?cally, using 2,4-diaminotoluene and 3,5-diaminobenzo-tri?uoride, two new triangular prisms, namely, CPOC-201-Meand CPOC-201-CF 3, respectively, can be prepared. Thesehave the same triangular prism shape as CPOC-201 , and alsocrystallize in the trigonal system, but in space group P-3 andP6122, respectively. Notably, with the introduction of thefunctional groups, their window diameters decreased from theoriginal 7.0 ? in CPOC-201 to 6.7 in CPOC-201-Me and 5.9?i n CPOC-201-CF3. These results suggest that it is possibleto use substituted m-phenylenediamine with bulky groups todecrease the windows further, and to prepare the Type 2porous liquids by dissolving them in solvents with bulkygroups.90,91On the basis of the above results of the analysis, itis revealed that the calix[4]resorcinarene-based POCs canprovide a new platform upon which to construct solublemultivariate materials, which are di ?erent from those reportedin MOF and COF systems.92,93Figure 2.

"Porosity Characterizations for Calix[4]resorcinarene-Based POCs. To investigate the permanent porosity of theaforementioned POCs, crystalline samples of the organic cageswere immersed and exchanged ?ve times every 24 h in MeOHor pentane before drying at 100 ∼C under high vacuum. Thepermanent porosities of the activated samples were con ?rmedby N2gas sorption experiments at 77 K ( Figure 6 ). As for the[2 + 4] dimeric cages, the N 2adsorption experiments suggestthat all the cages do not adsorb signi ?cant amounts of N 2, andshow less porosity with low BET values ( Figure 6 a and Table1). The ?exibility of the alkanediamine linker and the absenceof proper connectivity between the voids in the solid crystalpacking result in their being barely porous. It has beenreported that molecular compounds with intrinsic cavities werecapable of encapsulating speci ?c gases and/or vapors by host ?guest interactions.",topology
"75,123?125For [3 + 6] triangular prisms, N 2gas sorption measurementsrevealed a slightly reduced N 2capacity and a BET surface areaof 1143 for CPOC-201-Me , which might be ascribed to thechannels blocking the methyl groups. However, the BET valueofCPOC-201-CF3is close to that of CPOC-201 , whichapparently is a compromise between the blocked groups andthe cavity volume. The channels of CPOC-201-CF3arehindered by the tri ?uoromethyl groups, but its cavity volume islarger than that of CPOC-201 . For both [3 + 6] and [6 + 12]POCs, the N 2capacities and BET surface areas aresubstantially increased with the increase of linker length.Notably, both of the [3 + 6] and [6 + 12] POCs are linked bythe rigid diamine linkers, but their surface area increases arenot proportional to their cavity volumes. This might beascribed to the cage structures transforming during theseprocesses, especially for the larger compounds ( CPOC-202 ,CPOC-302 , and CPOC-303 ), as determined by powder X-raydi?raction (PXRD; Figures S31 ?S33). The high surface areasof such cages may have the ability to absorb other gases, andthus the preliminary research based on CPOC-201 andCPOC-301 as examples was carried out. It was found that theyboth can take up gases including H2,C O2, and C2H2withnotably high capacities ( Figures S53 ?S58).

With linear p-phenylenediamineand C4RACHO, a new structure type organic cage ( CPOC-301) can be formed. Single-crystal X-ray di ?raction analysisreveals that CPOC-301 belongs to the space group P-31mwithin the triclinic crystal system, and has an octahedralstructure. Within this structure, 6 molecules of C4RACHO actas the vertices, and 12 p-phenylenediamine molecules are theedges ( Figure 4 ). Its calculated minimum cavity diameter andvolume are 16.8 and 4270 ?3, respectively. This CPOC-301octahedron possesses eight trigonal ports with an averagelength of ‵1.2 nm, and a maximum accessible pore windowdiameter of 7.0 ?. It is also able to introduce functional groupson its edges and thus modify its port size and environment(Figures S45 and S46 ). A sophisticated method would be tosystematically expand the pores in MOF and COF materials byincreasing phenylene ring of the linkers in reticular chemistry,but this has not been achieved in the POC systems. With thisin mind, we used the longer ditopic linear phenylenediaminelinkers, including 4,4 ∩-diaminobiphenyl (two phenylene rings)and 4,4 ∪-diamino- p-terphenyl (three phenylene rings), andobtained the corresponding [6 + 12] hexameric octahedraCPOC-302 andCPOC-303 , respectively.

General synthetic and analytical methods Materials: 1,3,5-Triformylbenzene was purchased from Manchester Organics (UK), (R,R)-cyclohexyl-1,2-diamine was purchased from Fluorochem, and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or TCI UK. Hexachloropropene was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Other solvents were reagent or HPLC grade and purchased from Fisher Scientific. All materials were used as received unless stated otherwise. Synthesis: All reactions were stirred magnetically using Teflon-coated stirrer bars. Where heating was required, the reactions were warmed using a stirrer hotplate with heating blocks, with the stated temperature being measured externally to the reaction flask with an attached probe. Removal of solvents was done using a rotary evaporator. NMR: 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were acquired using an internal deuterium lock for the residual protons in CDCl3 (汛 = 7.26 ppm) or CD2Cl2 (汛 = 5.32 ppm) at ambient probe temperature on the following instruments: Bruker Avance 400 (400 MHz) or Bruker DRX500 (500 MHz) spectrometers. In order to avoid mixing of porous liquids (PLs) with deuterated solvents or TMS, NMR studies with the PLs were conducted using in-house calibrated CD2Cl2/TMS capillaries so that there was no effect on the PL. Data are presented as follows: chemical shift, integration, peak multiplicity (s = singlet, m = multiplet), and assignment. Chemical shifts are expressed in ppm on a 汛 scale relative to 汛TMS (0 ppm) or 汛CDCl3 (7.26 ppm).  13C NMR Spectra were recorded using an internal deuterium lock using CDCl3 (汛 = 77.16 ppm) or CD2Cl2 (汛 = 54.00 ppm) at ambient probe temperatures on the following instruments: Bruker Avance 400 (101 MHz) or Bruker DRX500 (126 MHz) spectrometers. 129Xe NMR Spectra were recorded using an internal deuterium lock using a sealed capillary of TMS in CD2Cl2 at ambient probe temperature on the following instrument: Bruker DRX500 (138.3 MHz). HRMS: High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was carried out using an Agilent Technologies 6530B accurate-mass QTOF Dual ESI mass spectrometer (capillary voltage 4000 V, fragmentor 225 V) in positive-ion detection mode. The mobile phase was MeOH + 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. PXRD: Laboratory powder X-ray diffraction data were collected in transmission mode on samples held on thin Mylar film in aluminium well plates on a Panalytical X'Pert PRO MPD equipped with a high throughput screening (HTS) XYZ stage, X-ray focusing mirror and PIXcel detector, using Ni-filtered Cu K汐 radiation. Data were measured over the range 4每40∼ in ~0.013∼ steps over 60 minutes. Viscosity Measurements: Viscosity measurements were carried out using a calibrated RheoSense 米VISC viscometer (0.01-100 cP). Measurements were repeated a minimum of three times with the average viscosity reported. Gas Sorption Analysis: Surface areas were measured by nitrogen sorption at 77.3 K. Powder samples were degassed offline at 90 ∼C for 15 h under dynamic vacuum (10-5 bar) S3  before analysis, followed by degassing on the analysis port under vacuum, also at 90 ∼C. Isotherms were measured using a Micromeritics 2020, or 2420, volumetric adsorption analyzer. Gas uptake measurements for CH4, CO2, and Xe were taken at a temperature of 293 K, stabilized using a circulating water chiller/heater, and N2 were taken at a temperature of 77 K. Gas Uptake and Evolution Studies: All samples of the PL were tested with gases purchased from BOC of the following grades: carbon dioxide (N5.0), methane (N4.5), xenon (N5.0), and nitrogen (N4.8), in GC headspace vials (22 mm x 45 mm screw top, 10 mL, Fisher Scientific). All samples had gas addition and measurements conducted between 20 and 25 ∼C in a temperature-controlled laboratory. The flow rate of gas addition was measured using a Gilmont calibrated/correlated flowmeter (tube size 0, Gilmont EW-03201-22) with a stainless steel float on a scale of 1-100, as reported previously.[1] The flow of each gas was calculated from the supplied correlated flow table for air, and general correction equations for approximating gas flow from air using the density of each gas in g/mL at standard conditions taken from the NIST Chemistry WebBook[2] (Gilmont flowmeter calibrated at 1 atm, 294 K), with corrections for temperature and pressure. After optimisation, each gas was maintained at ~50-60 mL/min flow rate by setting the regulator output pressure to 0.5 bar and fine-controlling the flow with a needle valve to the calculated scale readings. Gas evolution was measured by displacement of water in an inverted Rotaflo stopcock 10 mL burette (0.1 mL graduations) in a beaker of water connected to the GC vial containing the sample via a needle/tubing cannula. Measurements were repeated a total of three times at the same temperature to obtain a mean gas evolution and corresponding standard deviation.S4  2.

"[20]The discretenature of POCs has led to attempts to produce Type1 PLs,[13,21]and to the successful production of Type 2PLs.[1,22]The latter PLs were obtained by dissolving POCs athigh concentration in a solvent that was too bulky to passthrough the windows of the cage.

Since the CH4has notadopted the same diffusion co-efficient as the POCs, thisindicates that the gas is in dynamic equilibrium on the NMRtimescale between the POC cavity and the HCP solvent.",topology

The crude product was washed with diethyl ether (3 ℅ 100 mL) before being dissolved in the minimum amount of 1:1 DCM/hexane and concentrated in vacuo to precipitate the product. The resulting solid (6.07 g, 4.7 mmol, 75 %) was recovered by vacuum filtration and dried in a vacuum oven overnight. | (R,R)-Cyclohexyl-1,2-diamine    | Purchased, no synthesis procedure provided        | 1,3,5-Triacetylbenzene | Purchased, no synthesis procedure provided        |

After guestexchange ,noremarkable CDsignal attenuation wasobservedfornolessthan seven days (Figure 5),indicating that thechirality of2d12/C0was rather stable inwater. Possibleexplanations include ,i)thecarboxylate units form hydrogenbonds with theprotons inthecentral phenyl units ofthe1d3/C0residues ,ii)awatermolecule bridges twoadjacent carboxyl-ateanions in1d3/C0residues .Suchhydrogen bonds raise theenergy barrier offlipping the phenyl units,preventingracemization of2d12/C0.Suchstrategy ofguest-induced chiralitywasalsoemployed byother groups .[20]ConclusionInsummary ,asetofstructurally similar tetrahedra wereself-assembled bycondensing atrisamino linker andatris-benzaldehyde precursor bearing substitutional units inthemeta positions with respect totheformyl groups .Theformation oftetrahedra isattributed tothetwoortho protonsthat areinvolved ineither CH宛宛宛 pinteractions orhydrogenbonds within thecage framework.

"The porosity of cages was estimated using carbon dioxide(CO 2) sorption at 196 K, as they exhibit less signi らcant N 2sorption behavior at 77 K (Fig. S44 藩S49?), which is o 摲enobserved in porous molecular organic crystals such ashydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs),79,80supramolec-ular organic frameworks (SOFs),81,82and POCs.83,84As displayedin Fig. 5 and Table S3, ?CO 2adsorption isotherms suggest thatthese hydrazone-linked POCs can adsorb a moderately highvolume of CO2with capacities up to 234 cm3g/C01at 196 K and760 mmHg. This value is comparable to those of other reportedPOC materials (PB-2, 265 cm3g/C01; Fe-PB, 225 cm3g/C01).45,85Thecalculated Brunauer 藩Emmett 藩Teller (BET) surface areas ofcages are within the range of 373 to 563 m2g/C01(Table S3 ?andFig. S50 藩S55?). Notably, these calculated surface areas do notmatch their cavity volumes, possibly due to the absence ofproper connectivity between cavity voids, and/or due to cavityvoids in the solid crystal packing being blocked by neighboringcages a 摲er desolvation (Fig. S38 藩S43?). Moreover, CO2andacetylene (C 2H2) adsorptions of HPOC-101 toHPOC-104 atroom temperature were also explored, a ?ording C 2H2capacityfrom 31 to 47 cm3g/C01and CO 2capacity from 24 to 33 cm3g/C01(Fig. 4c and S57 藩S59?). As they all prefer to adsorb C 2H2overCO2, dynamic C 2H2/CO 2(50% : 50%) breakthrough experi-ments for HPOC-102 and HPOC-104 were performed (Fig. 4dand S60 ?).

Althoughit has remained challenging to develop a general syntheticmethod for systematic preparation of versatile POC crystals, thiswork suggests that C4RACHO can be a good candidate to reachthis goal. Moreover, their application in removing watercontaminants has been explored.",topology
"Initially, using propanedioyl dihydrazide isolated a [2 + 4]lantern-shaped organic cage, namely HPOC-101 , constructedfrom two C4RACHO as vertexes and four propanedioyl dihy-drazide linkers as pillars (Fig. 1 and S1 ?). SCXRD analysissuggests that HPOC-101 crystallizes in a triclinic system witha space group of P-1, exhibiting two cage molecules per unit celland eight DMF solvent molecules. These DMF molecules are alllocated in the cage interstices (Fig. S2 ?).HPOC-101 consists ofone central lantern-shaped cavity and four rhombus-shapedwindows, which remarkably resemble our previously reportedamine-linked organic cage constructed from propane-1,3-diamine. Its cavity height is about 1.34 nm (measured betweenScheme 1 Self-assembly of organic cages constructed from the tet-ratopic C4RACHO cavitand and dihydrazide linkers.",topology

"Notably, these four 發exible alkanedihydrazide linkers have notbeen previously employed in constructing organic cages.SCXRD measurements reveal that they exhibit the same [2 + 4]assembly modes as HPOC-101 . Except for HPOC-104 , whichcrystallizes in the monoclinic C2/cspace group, the remainingHPOC-102 andHPOC-103 both crystallize in the triclinic spacegroup P-1, the same as HPOC-101 . In the extended structures ofHPOC-102 toHPOC-104 , their cage cavities and/or intersticesareらlled with DMF solvent molecules (Fig. S3 藩S5?). Furtherinspection of their crystal structures demonstrated that oxygenatoms of alkanedihydrazides from HPOC-101 toHPOC-103 areon the same side, while those in HPOC-104 are on the oppositeside. Such di ?erence leads to two calix[4]resorcinarene units inHPOC-104 with a gauche conformation, while the other threecages adopt eclipsed conformations (Fig. S9 ?). Accordingly,HPOC-101 toHPOC-103 can be regarded as regular lanterns,whereas HPOC-104 is a distorted lantern. By increasing thepillar length, the inner cavity height and cavity volumes fromHPOC-101 toHPOC-103 gradually increased from 1.34 to 1.61nm and 582 to 833 ?A3(Table S3 ?), respectively. Given thedistortion, the cavity height and volume of HPOC-104 are 1.59nm and 859 ?A3, which are close to those of HPOC-103 . More-over, the related window diameters for HPOC-102 ,HPOC-103 ,andHPOC-104 are 5.60, 6.32, and 6.60 ?A, respectively.",topology
"Following that, using V-shaped m-phthaloyldihydrazide andC4RACHO unexpectedly a ?orded a mixture of block-shaped(HPOC-201 ) and rhombus-shaped ( HPOC-301 ) crystal mixtureswith a ratio of about 1 : 7 (Fig. S1 ?). Such a phenomenon hasalso been observed in other supramolecular macrocycles,metal 藩organic nanocages, and organic cage systems.74藩77Allattempts to control the assembly of these two cages by varyingsolvent and/or temperature were unsuccessful. SCXRD analysisindicates that the block-shaped crystal is a common [3 + 6]triangular prism assembled from three C4RACHO cavitands asfaces and six m-phthaloyldihydrazide ligands as edges. On theother hand, the rhombus-shaped crystal possesses an unprec-edented [4 + 8] square prism with four C4RACHO faces andeight m-phthaloyldihydrazide edges (Fig. 2). Both structures aresigniらcantly di ?erent from previously reported dimeric cagesbased on m-phthaloyldihydrazide, but methylene-bridged tet-raformylresorcin[4]arene cavitands, demonstrating a slightchange in the cavitand parent that largely in 發uences theresulting cage shapes.",topology

"Finally, a gigantic octahedral [6 + 12] organic cage ( HPOC-401) was obtained from the self-assembly of linear tereph-thalohydrazide and C4RACHO units (Fig. 3). SCXRD analysisreveals that HPOC-401 exhibits a large asymmetric unit andbelongs to the orthogonal space group Pnnn with six cagemolecules per unit cell. Due to weak crystal di ?raction, DMFsolvent molecules in the cage cavity and interstice were alsochallenging to determine. Its molecular shape is similar to thatof the reported organic cage constructed from the C4RACHOsca?old and p-phenylenediamine linkers. HPOC-401 featuresan extra-large octahedral cavity and eight trigonal windows. Itscalculated maximum cavity diameter (measured betweenbottom centers of opposite C4RA units) and volume are about3.25 nm and 6800 ?A3, which are the largest in reported hydra-zone-linked organic cages characterized by SCXRD. To date, thelargest reported hydrazone-linked organic cage is a [3 + 3] RC4A-based cage constructed from three tetraformyl-functionalizedRC4As and three tetrahydrazone-functionalized RC4As, con-taining an internal cavity with a maximum diameter of 2.12 nmand volume of about 1883 ?A3calculated by Voidoo.56Moreover,the average length of the trigonal window is about 2.0 nm(measured between the neighboring bridge carbon of C4RAunits), which is large enough to accommodate a molecule witha diameter of 9.51 nm.",topology
"The crystal data, window diameters, and cavity volumes forthe abovementioned hydrazone-linked POCs are summarized inTable S3. ?Apart from SCXRD data, the aforementioned hydra-zone-linked C4RA-based POC samples were further character-ized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), mass-spectrometry (MS), and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1HNMR) analytical measurements. FT-IR spectra of all POCsexhibit a characteristic C ]N stretching around 1666 cm/C01(Fig. S12 藩S18?).1H NMR spectra do not show any characteristicpeak of 藩CHO of C4RACHO; instead, they show peaks charac-teristic of H 藩C]N at about 8.6 ppm for [2 + 4] hydrazone-linkedPOCs and about 9.0 ppm for the remaining POCs (Fig. S19 藩S24?). Moreover, the observed m/zvalues of molecular ion peaksfor each POC were consistent with their calculated molarmasses (Fig. S25 藩S31?), demonstrating the presence of intacthydrazone-linked cages in solutions. Thermogravimetric anal-ysis (TGA) reveals that POCs are thermally stable up to /C24280/C14Cunder nitrogen (N 2) gas (Fig. S32 藩S37?). In addition, their waterstability was con らrmed by measuring1H NMR spectra of POCsamples being soaked in water for a week, and the unchangedsignals indicate the robustness of cages in water (Fig. 4 insetand Fig. S20 藩S24?). Notably, these hydrazone-linked cagearchitectures remain intact following guest solvent removalbecause the above-mentioned FT-IR, MS, and1H NMR charac-terization studies are conducted on desolvated samples.",topology
"ConclusionsIn summary, we have developed a general synthetic methodusing DMF as a solvent for constructing versatile hydrazone-linked POCs using the same tetraformylresorcin[4]arene cav-itand and three di ?erent types of dihydrazide ligands, including發exible alkanedihydrazide, V-shaped m-phthaloyldihydrazide,and linear terephthalohydrazide based on the hydrazonecoupling reaction. Five types of calix[4]-resorcinarene-basedPOCs, such as the [2 + 4] lantern ( HPOC-101 toHPOC-103 ), [2 +4] distorted lantern ( HPOC-104 ), [3 + 6] triangular prism ( HPOC-201), [4 + 8] square prism ( HPOC-301 ), and [6 + 12] octahedron(HPOC-401 ), have been obtained and characterized by SCXRD,FT-IR, MS,1H NMR, and TGA measurements. Their windowdiameters and cavity volumes can be precisely tuned from 5.4 to11.1 ?A and 580 to 6800 ?A3using speci らc dihydrazide linkers. Tothe best of our knowledge, the square prism shape of HPOC-301has not been observed in organic cage systems, whereas HPOC-401is the largest hydrazone-linked organic cage with a uniqueX-ray crystal structure. Moreover, the abovementioned sevenPOCs greatly increase the number of hydrazone-linked organiccages with determined crystal structures, as only four of themwere previously solved by SCXRD. Moreover, this study mayshed light on solving the di ?culty in hydrazone-linked COFcrystal growth and structure determination. Interestingly, thesehydrazone-linked POCs are stable in water and can e ?ectivelyremove various types of water pollutants from radionuclidewaste, toxic heavy metal ions, and organic micropollutants. Tothe best of our knowledge, HPOC-101 and HPOC-401 are theらrst two examples of POC adsorbents for systematic removal ofmany kinds of these pollutants. This らnding not only revealsthat CR4ACHO can be regarded as an excellent molecularbuilding block to construct versatile robust POCs but alsobroadens the application of POC materials in aqueous systems.Research on rational construction of robust calix[4]Fig. 5 (a) Time-dependent adsorption of aqueous I 3/C0by hydrazone-linked POCs, inset: the recyclability of HPOC-101 for I 3/C0removal.

"28Section S4e. PXRDs of HPOCs:PXRD analysis showed that all the experimental  powder X-ray diffractograms of HPOC  samples do not keep their original  crystallinity compared to the powder X-ray diffractograms calculated  from their single crystal structure data. However,  [2+4] HPOCs still kept crystallinity after being taken from mother liquor as well as after adsorption, while  the rest larger ones quickly become amorphous. This might be ascribed  to that the packing of the isolated cage compounds are assembled by weak supramolecular  interactions, which are different  to MOFs and COFs assembled  with much  stronger coordination bonds and covalent bonds, respectively. These phenomena  are often observed in cage system, especially  for those with large cavities.S9-S11Fig. S38. PXRD  patterns  of HPOC-101 .",topology

In this work, two [3 ?2] imine organic cages (1 and 2) stemmed from distinct TPE-based dialdehydes (TPE-2CHO/TPE-2PCHO) and common tri (2-aminoethyl)amine were obtained. Both of them are fluorescence silence in solution and high-efficient AIE could be observed, which is different from all known TPE-based organic cages with AIEE properties. Because of the cage skeleton encircled by multiple benzene rings, the two cages can effectively detect various explosives including nitrobenzene, 2-nitrotoluene, 3-nitrotoluene, 4-nitrotoluene and 2,6-dinitrotoluene both in solution and in the solid state, in which cage 1 displays higher detection ability due to its nine encircling benzene donors   1.Introduction Nitro-aromatic compounds such as nitrobenzene (NB) and 2,6-dini -trotoluene (2,6-DNT) are widely used explosive materials, and they have brought considerable safety hazards. Therefore, the sensitive and accurate detection of explosives has always been a frontier research for scientists [1每3]. Nowadays, several analytical methods, such as trained canine teams, ion mobility spectrometry [4], gas chromatography [5] and fluorescence quenching [6每12], have been utilized for the effective detection of explosives. Among them, the fluorescence quenching has drawn much more attention due to its unique advantages, such as high sensitivity, rapid response time and low cost. However, traditional fluorescent materials often suffer from the obnoxious aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect when aggregation occurs, which extremely limits their practical detection values. In this sense, molecules with AIE property can solve this problem well owing to their strong fluorescence emission in the aqueous phase [13每15].",affiliation
"Nevertheless, locking the TPE structure into a rigid skeleton has greatly inhibited the intramolecular rotation and vibration. As a result, all these formed cages emitted fluorescence both in the aggregated state and in solution, and these cages exhibited aggregation-induced emission enhancement (AIEE) behavior. Actually, it is still meaningful and chal-lenging to develop new TPE-based organic cages keeping the basic character of TPE (no fluorescence in solution) and realizing high-efficient AIE instead of AIEE. It is well-known that the benzene rings of TPE can consume energy through the free rotation, which is the decisive factor for its non-fluorescence in dilute solution. Considering that all four benzene rings of TPE-based monomers in previously re-ported organic cages are tightly fixed, is it possible to leave some ben-zene rings of the TPE moiety free during the self-assembly of the cages, *Corresponding author.

"1藩6Although a few examples ofboronic ester cages, or those based on disulphide formation orother DCC reactions are known,7藩18,19 藩21,22 藩26no doubt, thevast majority of shape-persistent organic cages is relying onthe use of multiple imine condensation reactions,1which bearthe advantage to be transformed further to convert these tochemically robust cages,27藩31which is for the other type ofDCC reactions di ?cult or even impossible.32Among thoseimine cages, shapes, such as trigonal prisms,33藩35tetrahedra,36藩39truncated tetrahedra,40,41cubes,42藩46tetra-pods,47adamantoids48藩50and even more complexstructures51藩57have been realized as well as tubular structures,based on linear tetraaldehydes.58藩61,62Here we introduce [3 + 6] imine cages based on the conden-sation of triptycene tetraaldehydes with 1,2-cyclohexyl-diamines. Due to the inherent 120‵ angle of the triptyceneblades, the resulting imine cage contains concave 迼-wallsgiving the overall structure the shape comparable to those ofcucurbiturils,63藩67thus we call the compounds cucurbitimines(Fig. 1).Results and discussionA key-step in the achievement of cucurbitimines is the syn-thesis of a triptycene-based tetraaldehyde precursor, having ontwo aromatic blades two aldehyde units each and at the thirdone none. Therefore, we developed a route where electrondensity of one blade was diminished by turning it into a phe-nazine unit and in addition allowed us to install long solubil-izing hexyl-sidechains (Scheme 1). To achieve this first syn-thetic goal, hexamethoxytriptycene 1was partially oxidized tothe quinone 268藩70and condensed with phenylene diamine 371to give phenazine 4in 79% yield.72The next step is the intro-duction of the aldehyde groups. Finally, the tetraaldehyde pre-cursor was achieved by a three-step-method, which was basedon the fourfold chloromethylation to 5(60% yield), followedby basic substitution of chlorine by hydroxyl groups to giveFig. 1 Schematic representation of literature-known tubular [3 + 6]imine cages (left)58藩61and the cucurbitimines presented herein.

"With tetraaldehyde 7in hand, condensation reactions with(R,R)-1,2-cyclohexyldiamine 8were investigated under variousconditions (Scheme 2). Solvents, such as MeOH, MeCN, DCM,THF, toluene or CHCl3were used and the reactants withthe addition of a small amount of TFA (2 mol%) were stirred atroom temperature or under reflux. Although in all cases the[3 + 6] cucurbitimine cage was formed, as detected byMALDI-TOF mass spectrometry ( m/z= 2739), the corres-ponding1H NMR spectra revealed that only in DCM the purityof the crude material was high enough to allow isolation andpurification of the cage 9in 10% yield. However, the bestresults were achieved by layering solutions of the two reactantsand let them di ?use into each other, which has been widelyused by Cooper et al.",topology
"37,73,74Although in contrast to their cages,which usually crystallized during formation, here the reactionmixture still kept a clear solution. Nevertheless, by thismethod we were able to isolate cucurbitimine cage ( R,R)-9in49% yield by applying separation with recycling-GPC (gel per-meation chromatography,) besides 5% of the larger [4 + 8]cage ( R,R)-10(m/z= 3653). Using the enantiomeric ( S,S)-1,2-cyclohexyldiamine gave basically the same results and here thecages ( S,S)-9and ( S,S)-10have been isolated in 54% and 5%yield (Fig. 2). It is worth to mention, that the calculated heatsof formation (PM3) for the trimeric cage 9is瞁Hf= 751 kJmol?1(250.3 kJ mol per unit) and for tetrameric cage 10瞁Hf=975 kJ mol?1(243.3 kJ mol per unit) are very similar, if com-pared per unit ( 瞁瞁Hf= 7 kJ mol?1). Thus a more equal distri-bution would be excepted, if the cage products are in thermo-dynamically equilibrium. Since it is not the case in combi-nation with all the observations made under various reactionconditions, it is concluded, that the cages 9are rather kineti-cally controlled products than thermodynamically ones.",topology

"F o rt h e[ 4+8 ]c a g e s 10we were not successful to grow suit-able crystals for a detailed analysis by X-ray di ?raction. However,cage 9is very rigid and thus shape-persistent and the experi-mental structure determined by X-ray di ?raction fits nearly per-fectly to the calculated model (PM6). Thus we take thePM6 model of the larger cage 10f o rc o m p a r i s o nw i t hc u c u r b i t u r -ils. As in cucurbiturils the height is the same for all members ofthe family, the height is here also the same for cage 10and cage9(9.1 ?). Due to the higher symmetry, the distance between twoopposite oxygens at one rim can be measured. With 9.0 ? it issignificantly larger than e.g.for cucurbituril[8] CB8 (6.9 ?). Theinner diameter (distance between two opposite triptycene bridge-head carbons) is 12.0 ?. The calculated void volume is with368 ?3similar to what we estimated for CB8 with the PDB viewer(351 ?3) but substantially smaller than reported in literature(479 ?3).65Furthermore we calculated the electron density distri-bution, which is similar to curcurbiturils, but less pronounced(see ESI ?), so the curcubitimines may show a similar host 藩guestbehaviour as the cucurbiturils.",topology

9.   Determination of the Cavity Volume  The molecular model for the [3+6] -Cage 9 is based on single -crystal diffraction data of 9 which w ere imported in the Chem3D Pro 17.0 software in order to remove the hexyl substituents to simpl ify later calculations. The molecular model for the [4+8] -Cage 10 was modeled with Chem3D Pro 17.0 software. Further optimization of the model s was conducted in the Spartan 14 software using the PM3 semi empirical method.9-12  The determination of the cavity volume was carried out using SwissPdbViewer15 4.1.0 at the highest quality level ( Surface Preferences: Quality 6). Two dummy atoms were added to the cage models and positioned in front of the larger windows of the cage to prevent the 1.4  ? radius measuring probe from ↗falling out∫ of the cavity of the cage.,topology

"ConclusionsBased on a triptycene tetraaldehyde a new type of imine cageshas been introduced that have a similar shape than cucurbi-turils. Therefore, these imine cages are named cucurbitimines.Initial studies demonstrate, that small neutral guests arebound inside the cavity and that their exchange (here THF bytoluene) is kinetically suppressed due to the small windowsizes of the opening. By increasing the temperature, theexchange of guest molecules can be accelerated. This behav-iour is quite similar to that of the cucurbiturils. In contrast tothose, the here discussed cucurbitimines are much bettersoluble in organic solvents and, which for cucubiturils is quiterare,80are chiral, opening up new possibilities for classicalhost 每guest chemistry, but also for separation of volatile chiralcompounds.81Furthermore, we will look for possibilities to getthe larger members of the family ([5 + 10] and higher) to openup new vistas in supramolecular chemistry simply by enlargingthe windows 每as has been done before for cucurbiturils.",topology

"In contrast to the relatively large number and diversity of inter -locked coordination cages18, only a few examples of purely organic cage catenanes have been reported to date. The first example was reported by Beer et al.23 They exploited a template effect of sulfate anions interacting with carbamate units to prearrange two tripodal precursor molecules in such a way that the end-capping of these via a copper-mediated 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition resulted in the formation of a triply interlocked cage dimer in 21% yield. One year later, in 2010, Cooper and co-workers described that by changing conditions for the synthesis of a [4?+?6] imine cage by adding catalytic amounts of trifluoroacetic acid to the reaction solution in acetonitrile or dichlo -romethane (DCM), these [4?+?6] imine cages form triply interlocked dimers24, which was proven by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.

Gross?  ? & Michael Mastalerz?  ? Mechanically interlocked structures, such as catenanes and rotaxanes, are fascinating synthetic targets and some are used for molecular switches and machines. Today, the vast majority of catenated structures are built upon macrocycles and only a very few examples of three-dimensional shape-persistent organic cages forming such structures have been reported. However, the catenation in all these cases was based on a thermodynamically favoured 羽每羽-stacking under certain reaction conditions. Here, we show that catenane formation can be induced by adding methoxy or thiomethyl groups to one of the precursors during the synthesis of chiral [8?+?12] imine cubes, giving dimeric and trimeric catenated organic cages. To elucidate the underlying driving forces, we reacted 11 differently 1,4-disubstituted terephthaldehydes with a chiral triamino tribenzotriquinacene under various conditions to study whether monomeric cages or catenated cage dimers are the preferred products. We find that catenation is mainly directed by weak interactions derived from the substituents rather than  by 羽-stacking.",this paper's author

"In contrast to the reaction with aldehyde 2, here the 1H NMR spectrum of the crude product was very complex with a large number of peaks in the aromatic as well as in the aliphatic region (Fig. 2b ). The corre -sponding matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization每time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI每TOF-MS) revealed that in addition to the [8?+?12] OMe-cube ( m/z ?5,623.21), a [16?+?24] condensation product (m/z ?11,245.46) was generated and even a small peak with m/z ?16,868.53 was detected (Fig. 2c ), suggesting that a larger [24?+?36] species may have formed. Taking into consideration the complex 1H NMR spectra reported previously for triply interlocked cages24, it was assumed that these species are most probably catenated dimer (OMe-cube)2 and trimer (OMe-cube)3 rather than larger more symmetric and Nature ChemistryArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41557-022-01094-wexclusively at m/z ?16,868.69 (first fraction), m/z ?11,245.57 (second frac -tion) and m/z ?5,623.24 (third fraction), which exactly fit to a [24?+?36], a [16?+?24] and a [8?+?12] species, respectively. The 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. 3h) of the third fraction was very simple, showing signals compa -rable to OH-cube, and in combination with the mass spectrum (Fig. 3c )  this compound was clearly identified as the monomeric chiral [8?+?12] OMe-cube. Diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) in deuter-ated DCM at 295?K showed only one trace with a diffusion coefficient of D?=?3.09?℅?10?10?m2?s?1, which according to the uncorrected Stokes每Einstein equation corresponds to a solvodynamic radius of rS?=?16.9?? (Supplementary Fig. 308). In contrast to the relatively simple 1H NMR spectrum of monomeric OMe-cube (Fig. 3h), that of the [16?+?24] species was much more complex (Fig. 3i). Nevertheless, despite the large number of signals, most of them were sharp and did not super -impose, allowing a more detailed analysis of the structure (Fig. 4a; for detailed structural analysis, see Supplementary Information,  section 13). Two-dimensional NMR experiments identified eight dif -ferent types of imine protons and eight different methoxy protons  (Fig. 4b,c ). This is exactly the number expected for a triply interlocked cage dimer (see cartoon in Fig. 4h) Other possible catenanes, such as a singly interlocked dimer (Fig. 4g, 12 imine peaks) or quadru -ply interlocked dimer (Fig. 4i, six imine peaks), can clearly be ruled out. DOSY NMR in CD2Cl2 at 295?K showed only one trace of signals for ( OMe-cube)2, confirming that this is a single species. The diffu -sion coefficient D?=?2.67?℅?10?10?m2?s?1 corresponds to a solvodynamic radius of 19.6?? (Supplementary Fig. 309).

"ResultsSelf-assembly of the trefoil knot . A dicationic tetraaldehydeprecursor 12+﹞2Br每and (1 S,2S)-(+)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane((SS)-CHDA) were combined (Fig. 1A) in a 1:2 ratio in H 2O(1 mL). Here, H 2O was employed instead of D 2O, in order toavoid deuteration. After the mixture was heated at 80 ∼C for 12 h,the solution was cooled down to room temperature. CD 3SOCD 3(0.33 mL) was then added to the aqueous solution in order toperform1H NMR spectroscopic experiments. Both1H NMRspectrum (Fig. 2C) and ESI-HRMS (Supplementary Fig. S14)were recorded. ESI-HRMS reveals that a product, namely S-26+,containing three equivalents of 12+and six equivalents of ( SS)-CHDA, was obtained as the major product. Two predominantpeaks corresponding to [ 2每H]5+and [ 2+Br]5+were observedin the mass spectrum (Supplementary Fig. S14). The1H NMRspectrum shows a set of sharp resonances (Fig. 2C), indicatingthat the structure of S-26+is highly symmetrical. The assign-ments were con ?rmed by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy(Supplementary Figs. S6 每S13). The resonance corresponding tothe proton fin the biphenyl protons undergoes a signi ?cantup?eld shift of around 每2.4 ppm compared to the correspondingresonance in the precursor 12+(Fig. 2B). This result indicatesthat the biphenyl unit is buried deeply within the framework of S-26+and therefore experiences a shielded magnetic environment.",comprehensive synthesis

Sue4?, Linjun Wang1,2?,Feihe Huang1,5?& Hao Li1,5?The preparation of topologically nontrivial molecules is often assisted by covalent, supra-molecular or coordinative templates that provide spatial pre-organization for all components.Herein, we report a trefoil knot that can be self-assembled ef ?ciently in water withoutinvolving additional templates. The direct condensation of three equivalents of a tetraformylprecursor and six equivalents of a chiral diamine produces successfully a [3 +6] trefoil knotwhose intrinsic handedness is dictated by the stereochemical con ?guration of the diaminelinkers. Contrary to the conventional wisdom that imine condensation is not amenable to usein water, the multivalent cooperativity between all the imine bonds within the frameworkmakes this trefoil knot robust in the aqueous environment. Furthermore, the presence ofwater is proven to be essential for the trefoil knot formation. A topologically trivial macro-cycle composed of two tetraformyl and four diamino building blocks is obtained when asimilar reaction is performed in organic media, indicating that hydrophobic effect is a majordriving force behind the scene.https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31289-1 OPEN1Department of Chemistry, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, PR China.2Key Laboratory of Excited-State Materials of Zhejiang Province, ZhejiangUniversity, Hangzhou 310027, PR China.3Hangzhou Institute of Advanced Studies, Zhejiang Normal University, Hangzhou 311231, PR China.4College ofChemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, PR China.5ZJU-Hangzhou Global Scienti ?c and Technological Innovation Center,Hangzhou 310027, PR China.6These authors contributed equally: Ye Lei, Zhaoyong Li.?email: Andrewsue@xmu.edu.cn ;ljwang@zju.edu.cn ;fhuang@zju.",this paper's author

"Another question is that, what is the kinetic byproducts during the self-assembly? We thus performed the self-assembly of the trefoil knot at room temperature, in order to increase the life-time of the byproducts. Here, H 2O/CD3SOCD 3 (3:1, v/v) was used to avoid deuteration. Due to the instability of this intermediate, we were not able to isolate this compound and characterize it in a more conclusive manner. Mass spectrum (Supplementary Figure 27) clearly indicated the byproduct is a [4+8] compound, namely that it is composed of four equivalents of the tetraaldehyde and eight equivalents of the bisamine. The DOSY spectrum (Supplementary Figure 28c) clearly indicates that this [4+8] byproduct has a slightly smaller diffusion coefficient compared to the trefoil knot, implying that this byproduct has a slightly larger size or molecular weight compared to the trefoil knot ([3+6] product).   S23   1H NMR (Supplementary Figure 28b) spectra indicate that this [4+8] byproduct S-X8+﹞8Br每 is a Solomon link. In the 1H NMR spectrum, some of the resonances in this [4+8] byproduct also underwent remarkable upfield shift as occurred in the case of trefoil knot, indicating this [4+8] byproduct also has an intertwined architecture. Of course, it is also possible that the [4+8] byproduct is a [2]catenane composed of two [2+4] macrocycles. However, this [2+4] macrocycle contains two bulky ※speed bumps§.",topology

Proton nuclear magnetic resonance(1H NMR) spectra of POC samples were recored on an AVANCE 400(400 MHz) spectrometer from Burker at room temperature(RT). Mass spectra(MS) were performed on an Bruker Impact II UHR-TOF mass spectrometry with an ESI-L low concentration tuning mix as the internal standard at RT. Data analyses and simulations of MS spectra were processed on a Bruker Data Analysis software (Version 4.3). Fourier transform infrared(FTIR) spectra  (4000〞400 cm?1) were measured on a Magna 750 FTIR spectrometer at RT using KBr pellets. Thermal gravimetric analysis(TGA) curves were carried out on a NETZSCH STA 449C thermal analyzer by heating samples from 30 ∼C to 900 ∼C under a nitrogen(N2) flow. Powder X-ray diffraction(PXRD) patterns were measured at RT by a Mini 600 X-ray diffractometer from Rigaku.

"In the last decade, POC＊s Brunauer-Emmett-Teller(BET) surface areas have increased from the initial 624 m2/g up to 3758 m2/g[25,26], and show ability to storage H 2, CO 2, hydrocarbons, and so on[27〞29] . As for gas separation applications, although POC materials have shown good selectivity for gas mixtures, such as CO 2/N 2, CO 2/CH 4, C2H2/CO 2, C2 hydrocarbons based on the theory calculation via correlating pure component adsorption isotherms[30〞33] , only high similar C 2H2/CO 2, rare gas Xe/Kr, greenhouse SF 6/N 2, H2/D 2 isotope, and industrially important C2 and C3 hydrocarbons separation have been confirmed by mixed gas experiments to our best of knowledge[34〞38] . Compared to the COF and metal-organic framework(MOF) materials for gas separation  applications[39〞41] , the POC materials are still in their initial stage, and thus there is much room for developing new POCs and exploring their application in this region. Calix[4]resorcinarenes(abbreviate d as C4RAs), a subclass of calixarenes, are macrocyclic molecule with intrinsic cavities, and have been documented as good candidates to construct supramolecular cages, metal-organic cages and covalent organic cages[42〞44] . Our group[45〞54]  are particularly interested in preparing new RC4A-based porous materials, especially for the POCs, as well as their practical applications. More than 20 RC4A-based POCs with structural diversity from lanterns, triangular prisms, square pr isms to octahedra based on concave-shaped tetraformyl-functionalized C4RA(C4RACHO, Fig.1) OBB and diamine and dihydrazide linkers have been synthesized by our group[52,53] very recently. These POCs exhibit good capacities for H 2, CO 2 and C2 hydrocarbons adsorption, and some of them are capable to separate C2H2/CO 2 and C 2H6/C2H4[34,35]. As an extension of our work, we have tried to expand the C4RA-based POC family and also their applications by using other linkers with di- or multiple amine groups. In this paper, two new POCs constructed from C4RACHO and flexible xylylenediamine(XDA) isomers(Fig.1) are synthesized. Herein, the synthesis, characterization and CO2/CH 4 separation of the aforementioned POCs are presented and discussed.",surface area
"As shown in Fig.2(A), the CO 2 adsorption isotherms of both POC materials exhibit pseudotype I isotherms with saturated uptake of 131 and 115 cm3/g at 196 K and under 1.01℅105 Pa for CPOC-105 and CPOC-106, respectively. The corresponding BET surface areas based on the abovementioned CO 2 adsorption isotherms are 277 and 218 m2/g. It should be noted that cavitand-based organic cages are often able to encapsulate specific gases, such as hydrocarbons and CO2 by host-guest interactions for the nature of intrinsic cavity. Thus, CH 4 and CO 2 gas sorption by CPOC-105 and CPOC-106 were performed, because separation and recovery of CO 2 from flue gas and natural gas are important in view of environmental and energy point in recent years. As can be seen from Fig.2(B), both CPOC-105 and CPOC-106 show an obviously preferential adsorption of CO2 over CH 4 at 298 K and under 1.01℅105 Pa. Specifically, the adsorption capacities of CO 2 and CH 4 for desolvated CPOC-105 and CPOC-106 are up to 44/37 and 17/20 cm3/g, respectively. In order to calc ulate the isosteric heat of adsorption( Qst), their CH 4 and CO 2 gas sorptions at 273 K and under 1.01℅105 Pa were also been measured, which show   the same trend in comparison to the adsorption isotherms at 298 K(Fig.S14, see the Electronic Supplementary Material of this paper). The Qst values for CO 2 and CH 4 based on the adsorption isotherms at 273 and 298 K were fitted by the virial equation, and the calculated Q st values are 23.4/27.2 and 19.9/17.9 kJ/mol for CPOC-105 and CPOC-106 at zero coverage(Figs.S15〞Fig.S24, see the Electronic Supplementary Material of this paper), respectively. The ideal adsorbed solution theory(IAST) was applied to evaluate the adsorption selectivity of CPOC-105 and CPOC-106 at 298 K and under 1.01℅105 Pa. As indicated in Fig.2(C), the CO 2/CH 4 selectivity of CPOC-105 is up to 3.2 under low pressure and at 298 K for equimolecular CO2/CH 4 gas mixture, which is higher than that of CPOC-106 with a value of 2.1. With the increase of pressure, the selectivity values gradually increase up to 4.5 and 3.1 under 1.01℅105 Pa for CPOC-105 and CPOC-106, respectively.",surface area

Specifically, the use of para -position XDA affords lantern-shaped cage(CPOC-105) with a medium cavity of ca. 0.526 nm3, while the meta -position produces peanut-shaped structure(CPOC-106) with two small cavities of ca. 0.181 nm3. Both CPOC-105 and CPOC-106 exhibit high selectivity capture of CO 2 over CH 4 with calculated selectivity coefficients of 4.5 and 3.1, respectively, under ambient conditions, and are capable of separating CO 2/CH 4 mixtures by fixed-bed column breakthrough experiments.",this paper's author

This cage has one central lantern-shaped cavity and four quadrilateral windows.",topology
"The overall geometry of CPOC-105 is similar to our recently reported [2+4] cages, constr ucted from two C4RACHO units and four ?exible alkanediamine linkers[52]. The calculated cavity volume of CPOC-105 is 0.526 nm3 by Voidoo[58]. Using m-XDA in place of p-XDA that was used in the synthesis of abovementioned cage affords CPOC-106. Notably, the XDA＊s angle has a big influence on the resulting cage topology. Unlike the lantern-shaped CPOC-105, single-crystal X-ray diffraction suggests that CPOC-106 is a rare [2+4] peanut-shaped structure(Fig.1). It belongs to the space group P21/c within monoclinic crystal system, and comprises a whole cage, an m-dichlorobenzene, and three CHCl3 molecules in its asymmetric unit(Fig.S2, see the Electronic Supplementary Material of this paper). Two CHCl 3 molecules locate in the cavity of CPOC-106, and the rest CHCl 3 and m-dichlorobenzene molecules are around the cage. CPOC-106 contains two small cavities with each volume of 0.181 nm3, which is determined by Voidoo, as the central channel of this cage is not able to pass a molecu le with a radius of 0.14 nm. In addition, thermal gravimetric experiments of both cages indicate high thermal stability with decomposition temperature more than 300 oC(Fig.S3 and Fig.S4, see the Electronic Supplementary Material of this paper). Notably, both samples lost their crystalline and transformed into amorphous state after desolvating in high vacuum(Figs.S5 and Fig.S6, see the Electronic Suppl ementary Material of this paper). However, the 1H NMR, FTIR, together with MS spectra of the desolvated CPOC-105 and CPOC-106 samples highly reveal the cage architectures of both desolvated samples are intact(Fig.S7〞Fig.S12, see the Electronic Supplementary Material of this paper). As can be seen from the 1H NMR and FTIR spectra, it is obvious that the imine bonds in both cages transfer to amine bonds through keto-enamine tautomerization, which have also been observed in our previous reported C4RA-based POCs[52].",topology

Geometry Optimized ModelsThe initial structures of CPOC-302-Pro and CPOC-401-Pro were  token from their crystal structures and modified using Materials Studio to add the substituent group. The geometry optimizations were employed  the GFN1-xTB methodS13, S14 with Grimme＊s D3 van der Waals  dispersion correction  using the CP2K  codeS15. GFN-xTB is a method of self-consistent, third-order, density functional  tight-binding (DFTB3), suitable  for the calculation of structures,  vibrational frequencies,  and non-covalent interactions in large  molecular systems. Only atomic coordinates of the periodic systems were  optimized, and the cell parameters  were fixed.)  A convergence threshold of 3.0 ℅ 10?6 Hartree was used for all self-consistent field (SCF)  calculations. The structural optimizations were considered converged if the maximum  force on all atoms  falls below 4.5 ℅ 10?4 Hartree Bohr?1.",CCDC
"Subsequently to illustrate the generality of the chiral POCcatalysts, we investigated the scope of substrates. The productsthat were obtained catalyzed by CPOC-302-Pro are presented inTable 2. It was found that aromatic aldehydes substituted withvarious electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro, cyano, tri-祇uoromethyl and pyridine can be employed with cyclohexanoneleading to the corresponding products with excellent yields (90 每99%) and stereoselectivities (80 : 20 每97 : 3 dr values, 87 每92% eevalues). Substituted cyclohexanones and tetrahydropyran-4-onewere also found to be well-tolerated, a ?ording the desiredproducts in high yields with good stereoselectivity. In order toacquire higher enantioselectivity, the reactions of substrates,including cyclopentanone and acetone, with smaller molecularvolume, were studied at 0/C14C. It was observed that cyclo-pentanone could react with p-nitrobenzaldehyde to provide theproduct with good enantio-selectivity (86% ee), while the reac-tion between acetone and p-nitrobenzaldehyde a ?ords onlymoderate enantioselectivity (64% ee).

El-Sayed,abdZhanfeng Juaand Daqiang Yuan *abcThe e ?cient preparation of chiral porous organic cages (POCs) with speci ?c functions is challenging, andtheir application in asymmetric catalysis has not previously been explored. In this work, we have achievedthe construction of chiral POCs based on a supramolecular tetraformyl-resorcin[4]arene sca ?old withdi?erent chiral proline-modi ?ed diamine ligands and utilizing dynamic imine chemistry. Theincorporation of V-shaped or linear chiral diamines a ?ords the [4 + 8] square prism and [6 + 12]octahedral POCs respectively. The appended chiral proline moieties in such POCs make them highlyactive supramolecular nanoreactors for asymmetric aldol reactions, delivering up to 92% ee. The spatialdistribution of chiral catalytic sites in these two types of POCs greatly a ?ects their catalytic activities andenantioselectivities. This work not only lays a foundation for the asymmetric catalytic application of chiralPOCs, but also contributes to our understanding of the catalytic function of biomimetic supramolecularsystems.",this paper's author

"The diamine ligands A3and B3could be regarded as thefunctionalized derivatives of the V-shaped m-phenylenediamineand linear 4,40-diaminobiphenyl. Our previous work showedthat the V-shaped phenylene-diamine linkers give rise to [3 + 6]trimeric triangular prisms, while the linear phenylene-diaminelinkers lead to the formation of [6 + 12] hexameric octahedra.",topology
"Because of the steric hindrance of the proline unit, the existenceof chiral proline moieties in the linkers can not only a ?ect thepore size and environment of POCs, but may also induce theformation of novel self-assembly forms.To explore the in 祇uence of the chiral proline units on theself-assembly behaviors of calix[4]resorcinarene-based POCs,we祈rst examined the self-assembly mode of the V-shapeddiamine ligand ( A3). Surprisingly, the reaction betweenC4RACHO and A3in CHCl3produced an unprecedented chiral[4 + 8] tetrameric cage CPOC-401-Pro (Fig. 1). Compared withthe [3 + 6] trimeric triangular prisms, the [4 + 8] tetramericsquare prism that was obtained has a larger window diameter,which undoubtedly weakens the steric hindrance caused by thebulky chiral proline groups. Although the isotopic distributionpatterns of [3 + 6] trimeric cage were detected in reactionsolutions, the crystalline samples of [4 + 8] tetrameric cage ob-tained by di ?usion proved to be the main product. The goodsolubility of CPOC-401-Pro in common organic solvents facili-tates its characterization in solution. Due to the keto-enaminetautomerization of the imine bonds in CPOC-401-Pro, twoenamine-derived proton signals are observed at 9.27 and16.05 ppm in the1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spec-trum (Fig. S3 ?). Meanwhile, the amide proton signals are seen at10.01 ppm, while the proton signals for pyrrolidine units are inthe range of 1.74 每3.82 ppm, suggesting the successful incor-poration of chiral proline units. The structure of CPOC-401-Prowas further con 祈rmed by 2D1H-1H COSY and1H DOSY tests(Fig. S4 and S5 ?). According to the DOSY spectrum, the di ?u-sion coe ?cient ( D) of CPOC-401-Pro is calculated to be 3.39 /C210/C010m2s/C01and the hydrodynamic radius calculated by theStokes 每Einstein equation is 1.13 nm. In the high-resolutionelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF-MS) ofCPOC-401-Pro, the observed ion peak at m/zof 955.6886 corre-sponds to the [M + 5H]5+ion, unambiguously indicating theformation of [4 + 8] tetrameric cage (calculated m/z?955.6889)(Fig. 2a). In addition, the chiral nature of CPOC-401-Pro wascon祈rmed by its circular dichroism (CD) spectrum.

"Due to the very weak and low-resolution di ?raction data, theaccurate atomic positions of the substituents in CPOC-401-Procannot be located and re 祈ned, but two complete molecularcage units were observed in each asymmetric unit through theelectron-density map. The cage with substituents was modeledin silico and optimized the GFN1-xTB method with Grimme's D3van der Waals dispersion correction using the CP2K code basedon the preliminary crystal data. The results of both the experi-ment and the simulation showed that each cage molecule isconstructed with four C4RACHO as the vertices, and eight A3molecules as the edges, thus forming a tetrameric prismstructure with eight chiral proline groups modi 祈ed on the cageskeleton (Fig. 1). Compared with the [3 + 6] trimeric triangularprisms, the [4 + 8] tetrameric square prisms that were obtainedshould be self-assembly forms with relatively lower energybecause of the bulky chiral proline moieties. This resultsuggests that the presence of substituents may lead to changesin the self-assembly mode of POCs.",topology

"←RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe?rst employed a fragment coupling approach by takingadvantages of the three progressive and controllable reactionsites of cyanuric chloride.20Reaction of ( S)-binaphthol (( S)-1)with 2.5 equiv of cyanuric chloride ( 2) in THF at 0 ∼C withdiisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) as an acid scavenger a ?ordedthe trimer ( S)-3in an 89% yield ( Scheme 1 ). Macrocyclizationbetween equimolar amounts of ( S)-3and ( S)-binaphthol wentsmoothly in acetone at rt and gave the desired product of(S,S)-Min a 52% yield, which was better than that of areported protocol35(33% yield, acetonitrile as solvent). Thefurther reaction of the macrocycle with another equivalent of(S)-binaphthol in acetonitrile via heating at re ?ux for 12 h inthe presence of K2CO3a?orded ( S,S,S)-Cage in a high yield of85%.",comprehensive synthesis
"With the success of the fragment coupling approach, wewondered if a direct one-pot approach would work. To ourdelight both the macrocycle and the cage could be readilyobtained in even higher yields by just mixing ( S)-binaphtholand cyanuric chloride in a given ratio ( Scheme 2 ). Thereaction of a 1:1 mixture in DIPEA/acetone at rt for 4 da?orded the macrocycle in a 42% yield. The yield was furtherimproved to 63% under K2CO 3/CH 3CN conditions within ashorter time (12 h) ( Scheme 2 a). Alternatively, the reaction ofa 3:2 mixture under K 2CO 3/CH 3CN conditions via heating atre?ux for 12 h a ?orded the cage in a 91% yield ( Scheme 2 b)!The simple operation and high e ?ciency allow multigram-scalemacrocycle and cage products to be a ?orded very easily. Theenantiomers, namely ( R,R)-Mand ( R,R,R)-Cage ,w e r esimilarly synthesized from ( R)-binaphthol. All the productsare essentially enantiopure (>99% ee) as determined by chiralHPLC (see the Supporting Information ).",comprehensive synthesis

As shown inFig. 3a and b, both cages showed a steep nitrogen uptake atlow relative pressure, which indicates that there are abundantmicropores in the cages. As illustrated by the red Connollysurface (probe radius = 1.82 ?), in the solid state, both 3P-1and3M-1can form connective lattice voids (Fig. 3c and d).

"3Moreover, C 2H2is usually produced fromfractionation and oil cracking, which always involve a smallamount of carbon dioxide (CO 2). Therefore, the discriminationof CO 2to a?ord high-purity C 2H2is critical to high-level safetyfor various industrial applications.4Traditional methods toseparate C 2H2/CO 2mixtures, such as solvent extraction andcryogenic distillations, not only su ?er from high energy-consuming and environment-unfriendly problems but alsopossess the risk of introducing secondary by-products. Conse-quently, it is of great importance and urgency to seek bettermaterials for safer storage of C2H2and high-e ?ciency and low-energy technologies to realize C 2H2/CO 2separation.In recent years, adsorption and separation technologiesbased on porous materials have shown promise in addressingC2H2storage and separation problems.5每7In this region, porousmetal 每organic frameworks (MOFs) have rapidly developed.8,9For instances, FJI-H8 and SNNU-98 , reported by Hong and Zhaigroups, respectively, have realized gravimetric C 2H2uptakevalues more than 220 cm3g?1under ambient conditions.10,11Furthermore, SNNU-45 , a MOF prepared by the Zhai group, hasdemonstrated the separation of C 2H2/CO 2with breakthroughtime up to 80 min g?1.12In contrast, the development of porousorganic materials (POMs) for C 2H2storage and separation ismarkedly slower than that of MOFs. To the best of our knowl-edge, POMs' C 2H2uptake values are generally less than 100 m2g?1under ambient conditions, and their ability to separateC2H2/CO 2mixtures viaactual breakthrough experiments is alsounderexplored.13Therefore, it is crucial to increase their C 2H2adsorption capacity and explore their C 2H2puri祈cation abilityto promote the development of POMs in this 祈eld.",surface area

An examination of theCPOC-107 's solid-state packing suggested that cage moleculespack viaweak van der Waals interactions, and there is alsoa one-dimensional channel in window-to-window mode(Fig. 1e).The presence of 1D channels in CPOC-107 and CPOC-203prompts us to study their porosity. Thermal gravimetric analysismeasurements showed their stabilities up to about 280 ∼C(Fig. S7 ?). Before the gas sorption test, both cages are immersedand exchanged 6 times every 24 hours in MeOH before acti-vating at 100 ∼C under a high vacuum for 12 hours. Powder X-raydi?raction reveals that a 徇er desolvation, no phase changeoccurs in both materials (Fig. S8 and S9 ?). N2gas sorptionexperiments con 祈rmed their permanent porosity at 77 K(Fig. 2), and both the isotherms of CPOC-107 and CPOC-203exhibited typical type I adsorption behavior with sharpincreases at a pressure below 0.1 P/Po, which reveals theirmicroporous nature.

"ConclusionsIn summary, we presented two novel C4RA-based POCs withhigh nitrogen content (>14%), including [2 + 4] lantern-shapedCPOC-107 and [3 + 6] triangular prism-shaped CPOC-203 . Bothcages exhibit high surface areas (>1100 m2g?1), and high C 2H2uptake capacity (>110 cm3g?1) at 298 K and 1 atm. Notably, thenitrogen content of CPOC-107 is up to 20.1%, and thus its C 2H2uptake capacity under ambient conditions is up to 146 cm3g?1,which is the highest among those reported for POMs. Moreover,CPOC-107 can also e ?ciently separate C2H2/CO 2with a break-through time of 13 min g?1. This work suggests that nitrogen-rich POCs can be promising materials for safer C 2H2storage,as well as C 2H2puri祈cation application. Further studies arefocusing on design and synthesis of functionalized POCs byintroducing speci 祈c group sites for improving their gas storageand separation performances.",surface area
"Nitrogen-rich porous organic cages with highacetylene storage and separation performance ?Lijuan Feng,abYifei Xie,aWenjing Wang,aKongzhao Su *acand Daqiang Yuan *acSearching for porous materials that can safely store and e ?ciently separate acetylene (C 2H2), a commonlyused petrochemical feedstock with highly explosive properties, is a pressing and signi ?cant task. Nitrogen-rich porous materials have garnered substantial attention for their ability to interact strongly with acidicC2H2. Herein, we report two novel nitrogen-rich porous organic cages (POCs), namely CPOC-107 andCPOC-203 , constructed from the same bowl-shaped tetraformylcalix[4]resorcinarene but di ?erentnitrogen-rich imidazolium-based diamine synthons. X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals that CPOC-107 adopts a [2 + 4] lantern-shaped structure, whereas CPOC-203 takes on a [3 + 6] triangular prismshape. Moreover, the cages exhibit large cavity volumes of up to 787 ?3and high speci ?c surface areasof up to 1202 m2g?1. Owing to their high surface areas and high nitrogen content, both cages exhibitimpressive C 2H2adsorption capabilities. Speci ?cally, CPOC-107 achieves a remarkable C 2H2uptakevalue of up to 146 cm3g?1at 298 K and 1 atm, the highest among those reported for all porous organicmaterials to date. Moreover, experimental breakthrough tests have con ?rmed the e ?ective separation ofC2H2/CO 2mixtures using the CPOC-107 adsorbent.",this paper's author

"View Article OnlineC2H2adsorption value under the conditions above is 146 cm3g?1forCPOC-10 7, which is higher than that of CPOC-203 , witha value of 114 cm3g?1. Both values are higher than those of ourpreviously reported cages with similar structural assemblies.Speci 祈cally, the C2H2uptakes for the previously reportedlantern-shaped [2 + 4] CPOC-101 toCPOC-104 (nitrogen content< 6.2%) are all less than 95 cm3g?1;38,46while for the reportedsimilar triangular prism-shaped [3 + 6] CPOC-201 witha nitrogen content of 5.8% the C 2H2uptake is only 91 cm3g?1.38The discussions above reveal that increasing the nitrogencontent in CPOCs can improve their C 2H2uptake ability.",topology

"Already a tert-butyl substituted  congener of  [4+6] -endo -cage 1 (Figure 1) is very badl y soluble in various solvents at room temperature,[20a]  so that originally an in -situ reduction of imine to amine -bonds was applied to indirectly proof the formation of the twelve imine bonds and thus the cage.[20a] Later on, it turned out that in hot DMSO -d6 a clean 1H NMR spectrum can be recorded even from the imine cage and crystals were grown from slowly cooling down this solution.[20b]  The tert-butyl groups made the compound at least slightly soluble in hot DMSO. If these are substituted by methyl -groups , the solub ility significantly decreased,[16a] and in case of hydrogens (1) at these positions, the resulting cage needed 22 days to form and was insoluble in all organic solvents.[16a, 21] As a consequence, the only analytical tools to characterize these cages were MALDI -TOF MS, IR, elemental analysis and gas -sorption.",topology
"In the case of 1 and 2 amorphous materials with small crystalline contribution s were obtained at concentrations of c(1) = 7.0 mmol L-1 (of triaminotrip tycene 4) in THF ( 1) or DMAc (2). Decreasing the concentration to c = 1.4 mmol L-1 led to the formation of crystals after 14 (for 1) or 28 days (for 2), proven by PXRD  (Figure 2, see also discussion below) which  were isolated in 18% ( 1) and 53% ( 2) yield. For the cubic [4+4] cage 3 this approach failed and an amorphous yellow solid was obtained from DMF already after 2 h ours. This mixture was kept at the elevated temperature  from which orange crystals slowly grew by Ostwald ripening[23] and after 11 days first single crystals were f ound.  After three months, single -crystalline material 3cr (see discussion below) could be collected in 7% yield by sedimentation using a pipette technique .[16a, 20b, 24]   Figure 2.

"All cage compounds are ins oluble in common organic solvents and have  thus been analysed using solid state 13C-MAS -NMR and IR -spectroscopy, LDI -TOF mass spectrometry, as well as elemental analysis (see Supporting Information). In LDI -TOF mass spectrometry the corresponding protonated molecular ion peaks at m/z 1881.6428 ( 1; calc. for C128H81N12O6+: 1881.6402), m/z 2061.7054 ( 2; calc. for  C134H93N12O12+: 2061.7036) and m/z 2525.7690 ( 3: calc . for. C172H101N12O12+: 2525.7662) have been found and neither smaller fragments nor higher masses as for example for catenanes[25] have been detected. In 13C-MAS -NMR signals in the typical region of imine carbon atoms (汛 = 160-170 ppm)  can be found  and the lack of signals in the region of aldehyde carbon atoms indicate completed condensations  (see Supporting Information) . While the spectra obtained for the cubic [4+4] -cage 3 are in correspon dence to the spectrum of its amorphous analogue published before,[18b] the spectrum of the exo-substituted [4+6] -cage 2 this time shows a well-resolved signal pattern with a conclusive assignment of the imine ( 汛 = 163.9  ppm), bridgehead ( 汛 = 54.3 ppm) and methyl carbons ( 汛 = 5.5 ppm; see Supporting Information). This is further supported by IR -spectroscopy where no carbonyl bands have been  detected  and the spectra correspond to the ones published before[18] (see Supporting Information) .",topology
"Triaminotriptycene 4 and resorcinol dialdehyde 5 have been combined in THF at room temperature for 18 days to obtain s ingle crystals of [4+6] -endo  cage  1 large enough for single crystal X -ray diffraction (in contrast to the too small crystallites obtained by the above mentio ned technique, Figure s 2 and 3 ). The cage crystallized in the triclinic space group P1? with Z = 2 and the electron -density of residual solvent molecules was removed by the SQUEEZE routine function .

"Layers aggregate  by 羽 -羽-interactions ( d羽-羽 = 3.29-3.61 ?) along the crystallogr aphic c-axis (Figure s 3e and 3h) leading to porous channels along  the crystallographic b-axis (Figure 3g). This dimerization motif can be considered as a main driving force in the packing of the reported imine cages as it can be found in all structures dis cussed in this report as well as the methyl - and tert-butyl substituted congeners of [4+6] -endo cage 1,[16a, 20b] but not in the soluble congeners published before[16b] (see discussion below).",topology
"Single crystals of [4+6] -exo cage 2 suitable for SCXRD analysis  where obtained directly from the reaction mixture as described above (Figure 2). 2 crystallized in the trigonal space group R3? with Z = 6 and with one third of the cage in the asymmetric unit (Figure 3i). This time, the central resorcinol units can be found alternating in an almost co -planar (? = 6.83-9.78∼) or distorted ( ? = 28.4-36.0∼) alignment with the adjacent triptycene paddles  (Figure 3i). The packing is mainly driven by 羽 -羽-interactions of the resorcinol -bisimine units with d羽-羽 = 3.51-3.60 ?. This interaction is found in all directions (Figure 3j -l) forming layers in the crystallographic ab plane (Figure 3m),  resulting in a thre e-dimensional porous framework with channels along the crystallographic b axis (Figure 3n).",topology
"In case of the [4+4] cube 3 two different crystal modifications have formed  (Figure 4). The crystalline material obtained from the reaction mixture after ripening and sedimentation (Figure 2) crystalized in the tetragonal space group I41/a with Z = 8 (Figure 5a-g) as truncated octahedra (Figure 4)  and is denoted as modification  3汐. A second modification ( 3汕) was obtained at a crystallization temperature of 150 ∼C as rhombic prisms (Figure 4). This time , the [4+4] cube crystallized in the monoclinic space group C2/c with Z = 4. In both cases identical  羽-羽-interaction motifs with d羽-羽 = 3.37-3.60 ? were  found (Figure 5b and 5d). For modification 3汐 this interaction propagate s along the crystallographic ab plane equally in four directions forming  inter-cage -voids with diameters of da = 1.10 nm and db = 1.07  nm (Figure 5e). Modificati on 3汕 show s these interactions two times in the same window on the opposing sides  of the cubes resulting in inter-cage -voids of da = 0.49  nm and db = 1.91 nm (Figure 5h). For both modifications , layer -like alignments are found along the crystallographic b axes (Figures 5f and 5i) and the packing leads to a three-dimensional porous structure  in both cases (Figures 5g and 5j). The denser packed arrangement of the cube in modification 3汕 is also reflected by its higher density of 0.892  g cm-3 vs 0.618  g cm-3 (3汐) and a higher overall packing energy (calculated  by the UNI -force -field method implemented in the Mercury program)[26] of -480.5 kJ mol-1 in comparison to  -434.8 kJ mol-1 (3汐).",topology
"The diffractograms of the activated materials obtained  by PXRD were compared to those  calculated from the SCXRD measurements discussed above (Figure 6). The single crystalline material of [4+6] endo cage 1 showed pronounced signals in PXRD measurements both before and after activation (denoted as 1cr), yet in comparison to data calculated from SCXRD a structural rearrangement during  thermal activation can be assumed because for example the five peaks between 2牟 = 8.13-9.32∼ are missing. For a direct comparison of 1cr to its amorphous analogue, 1 was s ynthesised with TFA and stirring and the fully amorphous material 1am (as proven by PXRD, see Supporting Information) was isolated in 92% yield.[21] 10.1002/chem.202302116Accepted ManuscriptChemistry - A European JournalThis article is protected by copyright.

"In the case of [4+6] -exo-cage 2, the diffractograms of the crystalline material (before and after activation) was in good agreement to the one  calculated from SCXRD (Figure 6e, thus denoted as 2cr1). In contrast to [4+6] -endo cage 1 and the synthesis of the amorphous  phase  2am[18a] of [4+6] -exo-cage 2 published before, a second crystalline material ( 2cr2) was obtained under stirring and acid catalysis, yet this time leading to smaller crystallites as indicated by SEM (see Supporting Information).",topology
"The single crystalline material  of [4+4] -cube 3 also remains crystalline after activation ( 3cr, see Supporting Information). The comparison of the corresponding PXRDs with diffractograms calculated from the SCXRD proves, that the two modifications 3汐 and 3汕 can be found in 3cr by signals at 2牟 = 8.8∼, 10.2∼ and 12.5∼ (corresponding to 3汐; indicated in blue in Figure 6f ) and 2牟 = 8.5∼, 10.5∼ and 12.5∼ (corresponding to 3汕 indicated in red in Figure 6f) supporting the observation by optical microscopy (Figure 4). The solids coll ected from the supernatant suspension of the sedimentation during the synthesis of 3 (see discussion above) still show  sharp signals indicating crystalline proportions, yet with a recognizable amorphous background (thus denoted as 3cr/am) and can be furthe r compared to the fully amorphous material 3am reported before.[18b]   All isolated solids where investigated by gas sorption analyses and compared to  the amorphous materials  published before (Figure 6 and Table 1).[18] For all three cages, the crystalline phases show almost 1.5 -2 times higher specific surface areas in nitrogen sorption experiments at 77 K than the corresponding amorphous materials (see  Table 1) with mainly type-I isotherms (Figure 6g).  This can most likely be explained by a denser packing o f the amorphous materials in comparison to the corre sponding crystalline ones and partially  blocking of pores in the amorphous states , leading to a main contribution of the intrinsic pores of the cage cavities to the overall surface in the amorphous materi als. In the crystalline states additional extrinsic pores between the single cages contribute to the overall specific surface areas[16a] which was also observed for giant cubic [8+12] -cage compounds before.[25a] It is worth mentioning that for  smaller porous organic cages the opposite behavior with increased surface areas in the amorphous state s was reported .[22d, 29]  10.1002/chem.202302116Accepted ManuscriptChemistry - A European JournalThis article is protected by copyright.

The amorphous material of the [4+6] -endo cage 1 shows a higher isosteric heat of adsorption ( 1am: Qst = 29.8  kJ mol-1) as the crystalline analogue ( 1am: Qst = 20.7 kJ mol-1) and similar trends  can be found for the  partially amorphous material 3cr/am (Qst = 44.7 kJ/mol ) in comparison to 3cr (Qst = 25.5 kJ/mol). This is further reflected in the resulting IAST as well as Henry selectivities (Table 1 and Figure 6i) with the amorphous materials 1am (SIAST = 26.6; SH = 53.8) and 3am (SIAST = 21.5; SH = 24.8) 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0012345   Uptake  [mmol g-1]p [bar]5 10 15 20 25 30 352q [∼]5 米m 4 米m 2 米m0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.00100200300400500600Uptake   [cc g-1]Relative pressure  P/P0         1cr1am2cr12cr22cr23cr5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Normalized Intensity2q [∼]8.2 9.4 11.0 23.4 12.7 13.2 13.8 14.3 17.4 21.1 preactivationpost activationcalc.

"This general trend can best be  explained by the alignment of the functional groups in both , the molecular structures and as a result  in the crystal packing. For cages 1 and 3 the hydroxy groups point inside to the cages ＊ cavities enabling the interaction  with gases of high polarizability  such as carbon dioxide  (汐′ = 27.250  au-3, 汐﹠ = 13.018  au-3).[32] In the crystalline states, additional extrinsic pores are formed leading to higher surface areas (Table 1 and discussion above) yet without any further decoration with polar groups. In  the amorphous materials, mainly  the intrinsic pores inside the cage cavity contribute to the surface area which leads to a higher functional group to surface area ratio resulting in higher selectivities showing some superior properties of selected amorphous materials as observed  before.[22d, 25a, 29b] This also explains why cage 2 with its exo facing functional groups show s by far the lowest selectiv ities of carbon dioxide over nitrogen ( 2cr1: SIAST = 8.1; SH = 8.1; 2cr2: SIAST = 13.4; SH = 13.4; Table 1) and the highest selectivities can be found for [4+4] -cube 13 with its twelve salicylimine functions in total .",topology

Melti ng points (not corrected) were measured with a B邦chi B -540 melting point analyser . NMR spectra were taken on Bruker Avance III 600 (600 MHz) and Bruker Avance III 700 (700 MHz) spectrometers. NMR spectra were internally referenced to residual solvent peaks  in CDCl3 (1H NMR: 汛 = 7.26 ppm, 13C NMR: 77.2 ppm). IR -Spectra were recorded on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer on a ZnSe ATR crystal. MALDI -TOF experiments were carried out at a Bruker timsTOFfleX  spectrometer, both with DCTB ( trans -2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl) -2-methyl -2-propenylidene]malononitrile) as matrix. Crystal structure analysis was accomplished on a STOE Stadivari diffractometer with a copper source ( 竹 CuK汐 = 1.54178 ?) and a PILATUS detector. Data processing and absorption correction (X -Area LANA 1.83.8.0)[S4] were accomplished by st andard methods.  Recycling gel permeation chromatography (rGPC) was carried out using a Shimadzu Prominence LC20 system with a  DGU- 20A3R degassing unit, a LC20AD pump unit, a CTO -20AC column oven, Ca BM-20A communication bus module, a SPD-M20A diode array detector,  an FRC-10A fraction collector  and an FCV -20AH2 valve unit  being equipped with a PSS SDV (20 ℅ 50 mm) pre -column and SDV ( d ℅ L = 20 ℅ 300 mm) columns ( 3 ℅ 100 ? for 3-Et cage ; 2 ℅ 500 ?  and 2 ℅ 1000 for cages  3-Me and 3-OPr).",affiliation

"Crystal Growth and Activation: The crystallization of F-cage is described here as a representative procedure. As-synthesized F-cage (1.20?g) was dissolved in dry THF (400?mL, c? = 3?mg mL?1) and filtered through a syringe filter (0.2? 米m pore). 10?mL of the filtered cage solution each was added to 40 individual snap-lid jars (25? mL, d? = 3? cm). All vials were capped, with caps with 12 pinched holes each and placed in two desiccators with the ground covered with methanol. After vapor diffusion of methanol into the THF cage solutions at room temperature for 21 days, the mother liquors for every vial were removed by a pipette technique and the residual crystals were washed with a methanol/THF mixture (Vmethanol /VTHF? = ?4/1) (3 ℅ 2?mL) and methanol (2?mL), again by pipette technique. The crystals of the different batches were combined as suspensions, the supernatant solvents were removed and the residual dried at high vacuum (1.2 mbar) for 14 h at room temperature to give pre-activated F-cage (890? mg, 74% efficiency of the crystal growth/activation procedure). Further activation was achieved by drying at a kugelrohr oven at 50 ∼C under reduced pressure (3 ℅ 10?2? mbar) for 14 h. Prior to gas adsorption measurements, the cage crystals were activated again at 40 ∼C for 3 h at the outgas station of the gas sorption analyzer and measured directly. The complete removal of enclathrated solvent molecules was verified by 1H NMR spectroscopic as well as TG analyses (see Section S11, Supporting Information) and the persistence of the crystallinity was monitored by optical microscopy along with SEM as well as PXRD and SCXRD (for detailed descriptions, see Section S12 and S13, Supporting Information).",comprehensive synthesis

"Although some of the crystals appeared cracked, the smaller crystallites still show sharp edges mainly along crystallographic axes. Interestingly, more cracks are apparent for H-cage than for HF-cage and F-cage, which is in line with the strengths of dispersion interactions of the hexameric units of side-chains, as discussed above. Thus, it is assumed that by activation the crystals preferably break along these units. This observed mac-roscopic trend is also reflected by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD; Section S13, Supporting Information). Obviously, the dispersion interactions between fluorinated chains are strong enough to fully maintain single crystallinity for the F-cage upon desolvation and activation, allowing to gain decent diffraction data of the apo-host that is having only a slightly enlarged unit cell (Section S7 and S8, Supporting Information).In nitrogen sorption experiments at 77? K as well as argon sorption at 87? K, only fully fluorinated F-cage took up sig-nificant amounts of gases allowing to determine Brunauer每Emmett每Teller (BET) surface areas of 752 m2 g?1 (N 2) and 728?m2 g?1 (Ar), respectively, while H-cage and HF-cage seemed apparently nonporous under these conditions (Figure? 3g,h). On first glance, this finding is contradictory to the trend of dispersion interaction strength discussed above. However, this permanent porosity is most likely attributed to a gen-eral higher solubility and thus easier diffusion of gases in fluorinated alkanes in comparison to their hydrocarbon ana-logs.",surface area
"[28] At elevated temperatures of 195?K,?all three cages take up noteworthy and comparable amounts of both nitrogen (H-cage: 0.58? mmol g?1; HF-cage: 0.67? mmol g?1; F-cage: 0.93? mmol g?1) and carbon dioxide (H-cage: 6.63? mmol g?1; HF-cage: 8.92? mmol g?1; F-cage: 8.66? mmol g?1) (see Figure S109, Supporting Information? and Figure? 3i) at 1? bar proving permanent porosity for all three cages. This indicates a kineti-cally hindered adsorption of nitrogen and argon at cryogenic condition for H-cage and HF-cage, which is underlined by pro-nounced hysteresis observed for H-cage and HF-cage and the absence of such for F-cage (Figure? 3i). The BET surface area derived from carbon dioxide adsorption at 195 K of F-cage is with 605 m2 g?1 between the one of H-cage (372? m2 g?1) and HF-cage (653?m2 g?1) (Figure?3j). The similar adsorption prop-erties at higher temperatures are further proven by similar alkane adsorption behaviors of all three cages at 273? K with uptakes of 0.7每1.0?wt% (0.46每0.61?mmol g每1) of methane, 5.6每7 .5? wt% (1.50每2.49? mmol g?1) of ethane, and 10.5每14.6? wt% (2.37每3.30?mmol g?1) of propane at 1?bar (see Figures S112每S114, Supporting Information). For instance, for F-cage, the propane adsorption corresponds to 9.09?mmol mmol?1 or 9.09 propane molecules per cage compound which resembles a filling of 84% of the cage void (for more details on pore fillings of different gases, see Section S16 and Table S17, Supporting Information).",surface area

Furthermore, the recyclability of F-cage was investigated with seven subsequent adsorption and desorp-tion cycles for c-C4F8 exemplarily (Figure?6c). It has to be noted that the material was stored for 204 days under ambient atmos-phere between cycles 1 and 2 and the uptakes of c-C4F8 were all in a range of 99每112% (cycle 1 was set to 100%) demonstrating the potential recyclability of F-cage in these kind of separations.",surface area

The mixtures were stirred at 100 ∼C for 3 days. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixtures were combined, filtered through syringe filters (0.2 米m pore) and concentrated to approx. 48 mL by rotary evaporation (55 ∼C). Methanol (80 mL) was added, and the obtained suspension was stirred for 30 minutes. The orange precipitate was filtered, washed with methanol (4 ℅ 20 mL) and dried under high vacuum (1.4 mbar) for 14 h at room temperature to give H-cage as orange solid in 87% yield (370 mg, 208 米mol)." | 2150479  | "The BET surface area derived from carbon dioxide adsorption at 195 K of F-cage is with 605 m2 g每1 between the one of H-cage (372 m2 g每1) and HF-cage (653 m2 g每1) (Figure 3j)." | Triamino triptycene | "2,7,14-triaminotriptycene 1 was synthesized according to a procedure reported in literature." | Salicylaldehyde 2a | "S5 2',5'-Dibutoxy -4,4''-dihydroxy -[1,1':4',1'' -terphenyl] -3,3''-dicarbaldehyde (2a) In a screw -capped-vessel salicylaldehyde S1 (3.44 g, 13.9 mmol) and dibromide S2 (2.00 g, 5.75 mmol) were suspended in THF (40 mL) and an aqueous K 2CO 3 solution (1 M, 10 mL) under argon atmosphere. 5 mol-% tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (266 mg, 290 米mol) and 10 mol-% tri-tert-butylphosphonium tetrafluoroborate (168 mg, 579 米mol) were added to the mixture. The suspension was heated to 80 ∼C and stirred for 16 h. After cooling to room temperature, the suspension was poured on water (20 mL), extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 ℅ 40 mL) and the combined organic layer was dried over Na2SO4. After removal of solvent under reduced pressure, the obtained crude solid was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, petroleum ether/ethyl acetate = 5:1, Rf = 0.48) to give 2a as colorless solid in 54% yield (1.36 g, 3.16 mmol)." |

"2. Synthesis and characterization   S3   Tris(salicylaldehyde) (㊣)-2. A screw -capped reaction tube  was charged with triol (㊣) -1 (600 mg, 1.28  mmol, 1.0  equiv), hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) (701  mg, 5.00  mmol, 3.9 equiv) and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (9.0  mL). Af ter purging with argon, the vial was sealed with a Teflon -lined cap and the reaction stirred at 100  ∼C for 1 6 h using a preheated oil bath. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature, poured onto a mixture of 2 M aqueous HCl (100  mL) and dichloromethane (100  mL) and stirred vigorously for 5  h to hydrolyze  the imium salt. The phases were separated, and the aqueous phase was extracted with dichloromethane (2℅100  mL). The combined organic phase was dried over Na 2SO 4 and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure.

Selectivity of chiral self -sorting   In the 1H NMR spectrum of the self -sorting reaction small signals, which do not belong to the  [8+12] cage compounds ( P)/(M)-4 or (P,M)-4 could be observed. An 1H DOSY NMR spectrum  clearly shows, that these signals do not belong to species with the same diameter than the [8+12] cages but to smaller oligomers or cage fragments. This proves that out of the 23 possible cage isomers  (see Figure S78) only three are formed in the self -sorting reaction .

"S41  5. 2D-NMR spectra   The 1H and 13C NMR signals reported in the experimental section were assigned with the help of 1H,1H-COSY, 1H,1H-NOESY, 1H,13C-HSQC and 1H,13C-HMBC NMR spectra. The signals of the deuterated TBTQ building blocks  and the deuterated cages (M)-5 and (M)-6 were assigned by comparison with the signals of their literature known non -deuterated congenersS1-S3 and the assignments were confirmed by 2D -NMR spectra (not depicted here ; for the deuterated  cages (M)-5 and (M)-6 no 2D -NMR spectra were measured ).

Thionylchloride (SOCl2) and inorganic salts including potassium carbonate, potassium acetate, sodium bicarbonate and magnesium sulfate were purchased from Greagent, China. Flash column chromatography was performed on silica gel (200每300 mesh) and the compounds were visualized under 254 nm on thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates.  2. Techniques 2.1 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 400 MHz and 101 MHz on a Bruker A V ANCE III HD 400 NMR spectrometer. NMR spectra were measured at 298 K in CDCl3, acetone-d6 or DMSO-d6. Their proton residuals are used as internal reference for 1H NMR, respectively. Proton and carbon chemical shifts (汛) are reported in ppm and coupling constants (J) in Hertz (Hz). The multiplicity in the 1H NMR spectra are described as s (singlet); d (doublet); dd (doublet of doublets); t (triplet); q (quartet); m (multiplet); br (broad). 2.2 Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometry MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed on a Bruker Autoflex speed TOF/TOF mass spectrometer and operated in reflective mode. Internal calibration was S4  performed using peptide (700-3500 Dalton) as standards. The analytical samples were obtained by mixing the CHCl3 solution of the sample (5 mg/mL) and CH2Cl2 solution of the matrix (trans-2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propene]-malononitrile (DCTB, 10 mg/mL) in a 1/5 (v/v) ratio. The prepared mixture solution of the sample (1 米L) was loaded on the MALDI-TOF plate and allowed to dry at 25 oC before the plate was inserted into the vacuum chamber of the MALDI-TOF instrument. 2.3 Single Crystal X-Ray Diffractometry (SC-XRD) The single crystal data of cages were collected on Bruker D8 VENTURE. The structures were solved by direct methods using the OLEX-2 software. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined using anisotropic thermal parameters.  2.4 Circular Dichroism (CD) Circular dichroism (CD) was performed with a JASCO J-1500 spectrometer. CD spectra of the solution of the cages were recorded in 1 mm quartz cuvettes at 25 oC after single crystals were picked up randomly and dissolved in 250 米L of chloroform. A scan rate of 200 nm min?1 with a response time of 1 s and a bandwidth of 5 nm were adopted. Time-dependent CD spectra at different temperatures were performed with different time intervals and recorded in 1 mm quartz cuvettes using 1,1,2,2-tertachloroethane (C2H2Cl4) or anhydrous THF as solvent. A scan rate of 200 nm min?1 with a response time of 1 s and a bandwidth of 5 nm were adopted at each temperature.  2.5 Chiral High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Analytical chiral HPLC was conducted on a Shimadzu LC-20AD system using CHIRALPAK columns (0.46 cm I.D. ℅ 25 cm L). Chromatographic condition for cages: IF column, eluent of CHCl3/hexane = 80/20 (v/v), flow rate of 0.6 mL min?1, UV detection at 295 nm at 30 oC. 3.

"As shown in Figure S8, satisfactory separation of triamine compounds could be obtained on CHIRALPAL column IA under optimized mobile phase (see Section 2 for details). Four major peaks were observed in the elution curve of the reaction mixture of the ring-opening amination of (rac)-2a, whose retention times locate around 21.5 min (12.7%), 23.3 min (12.5%), 26.1 min (37.7%), 32.9 min (37.1%). The experimental results are consistent with the ideal product distribution, where homochiral (3R)-2b and (3S)-2b each account for 1/8, and heterochiral (2R1S)-2b and (1R2S)-2b each account for 3/8. After purification, racemic triamine compounds rac-2b and hetero-2b were successfully separated, corresponding to two minor peaks at 21.1 min and 22.9 min as well as two major peaks at 26.0 min and 32.9 min, respectively. Through the further comparison experiments, rac-2b was definitely determined to be the racemic mixture of enantiopure (3R)-2b and (3S)-2b. Combining chiral HPLC chromatograms and 1H NMR spectrum, it could be concluded that the hetero-2 is a racemic mixture consisting of (2R1S)-2b and (1R2S)-2b.S227.

"8The porosityof some POCs has been shown to match that of COFs.1,6b,9Accordingly, POCs have been exploited in applications that relyon their porous nature, such as gas sorption and separation,10molecular sieving,11sensing,12catalysis13or transport of ions.14However, contrary to COFs, studies that explore the elec-tronic properties of POCs are rather scarce. Yet, organic cagesrepresent well-de 祈ned molecular architectures with buildingblocks arranged spatially with high precision, which is animportant requirement for electronic materials. As a result,properties that typically arise from the interplay of the inter-molecular electronic coupling between molecules in the solid-state could potentially emerge within a single cage due to itsthree-dimensional structure. Importantly, the incorporation ofchromophores or redox-active molecules could also allow theinvestigation of their mutual electronic communication both ina solution or in the solid-state.aDepartment of Chemistry, University of Basel, St. Johanns-Ring 19, CH-4056 Basel,Switzerland.

We attribute this result tothe residual nitrobenzene molecules blocking the voids evena徇er the activation of the samples under dynamic vacuum at120/C14C for 24 h because of the high boiling point of nitroben-zene (Fig. S64 ?). We reasoned that the cages crystallized fromTHF would allow us to remove the solvent molecules from thepores more e ?ectively. Indeed, we observed a signi 祈cantincrease in the BET surface areas (Fig. 3 and S60 ?). Cage 1ashowed a characteristic type I gas adsorption pro 祈le, an indi-cation for a highly microporous structure, with a BET surfacearea of 522 m2g/C01(Table 1). Further analysis of the adsorptionisotherm revealed that the micropores and external pores areresponsible for z60% and z40% of the total BET surface area,respectively. Interestingly, we observed almost no N2uptake atlow relative pressures for the PMDI cage 1buntil the pressurereached a value of p/p0z0.35, at which point a fast uptake of N 2occurred. Therefore, the BET surface area could not be quanti-祈ed in this case. In addition, we observed a non-closeddesorption isotherm without mesopore hysteresis for 1b. Thebehavior of 1bthus points to a gate opening phenomenonrelated to kinetic gas trapping, which is generally observed forso徇porous crystals and 祇exible porous cages.",surface area

Yet, organic cages o ?er importantmolecular advantages such as solubility and modularity. Herein, we report the synthesis of a series ofchiral imine organic cages with three built-in rylene units by means of dynamic imine chemistry and weinvestigate their textural and optoelectronic properties. Thereby we demonstrate that the synthesizedrylene cages can be reversibly reduced at accessible potentials, absorb from UV up to green light, areporous, and preferentially adsorb CO2over N 2and CH 4with a good selectivity. In addition, wediscovered that the cage incorporating three perylene-3,4:9,10-bis(dicarboximide) units displays ane?cient delayed ?uorescence. Time-correlated single photon counting and transient absorptionspectroscopy measurements suggest that the delayed ?uorescence is likely a consequence ofa reversible intracage charge-separation event.

"Results and discussionSynthesis and propertiesThe structure of the cages 1requires that a ditopic amine anda tritopic aldehyde react in a [3 + 2] condensation reaction(Scheme 1). Previously,19we synthesized 1aby re 祇uxing thediamine 2awith benzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde in tolueneunder Dean 每Stark conditions. However, this approach was notsuitable for the synthesis of 1cbecause the correspondingdiamine 2chas a very low solubility in toluene. Although, thecage formation could be detected by MALDI-TOF, a majority of2cformed an insoluble 祈lm leading to negligible yield andimpure samples. Generally, PDIs have a lower solubilitycompared to the NDI or PMDI derivatives. Therefore, we per-formed DFT calculations to estimate the relative stabilities of 1band 1cusing an isodesmic reaction shown in Scheme S1 ?priorto the synthesis. We found that all cages display similar stability(Table S1 ?) even when the solvent environment was included,which promised a successful synthesis of 1band 1c. The ther-modynamic control of imine formation demands that thestarting compounds are soluble to drive the equilibrium to theproducts. We therefore tried to synthesize 1ain dry chloroform,in which the diamines 2possess a su ?cient solubility. Weobserved a full conversion and a clean formation of 1ain 72hours at 80/C14C in 60% yield a 徇er puri 祈cation by HPLC. Itsuggests that 1ais the thermodynamic product in chloroform.",topology

| Cage 1a                            | None     | 2031730     | Cage 1a showed a characteristic type I gas adsorption profile, an indication for a highly microporous structure, with a BET surface area of 522 m2g??1. | Diamine (R)-2a (230 mg, 0.5 mmol) was suspended in a solution of benzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde (54 mg, 0.3 mmol) in dry chloroform (100 ml). The mixture was then stirred at room temperature for 72 hours after which the solvent was filtered through a disposable syringe filter. The filtrate was removed under reduced pressure to obtain a solid crude product. A small amount of methanol was added and the suspension was sonicated at room temperature for 30 minutes and filtered thereafter. The filter cake was washed with additional methanol followed by a portion of diethyl ether and dried in air. The crude cage 1a was purified by HPLC using CH2Cl2/n-Heptane (7:3) as eluent to yield a pure sample of 1a as a white solid (166 mg) in 60%. | Benzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde | None                            | Diamine (R)-2a | Previously reported compounds: (1R,2R)-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine. The corresponding enantiomers were synthesized using (1S,2S)-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine. |
| Cage 1b                            | None     | 2031731     | The BET surface area could not be quantified in this case. | The ditosylate salt of 2b (400 mg, 0.519 mmol) was suspended in a solution of benzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde (56.1 mg, 0.346 mmol) in dry chloroform (52 ml) and TEA (0.486 ml, 3.46 mmol) was added quickly in one portion to the stirred mixture in a pressure flask at room temperature. The pressure flask was closed and heated to 80∼C. After 72 hours, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and filtered through a disposable syringe filter. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain a white solid product. A small amount of methanol was added and the solids were sonicated at room temperature for ~30 minutes and filtered. The filter cake was washed with additional methanol followed by a portion of diethyl ether and dried in air. The crude cage 1b was purified by HPLC using n-heptane/CH2Cl2 (4:6) as eluent to afford a pure sample of 1b as a white solid (160 mg) in 62%. | Benzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde | None                            | Diamine 2b | A slightly modified previously-reported strategy was followed. (1R,2R)-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine (288 mg, 2.5 mmol) was added quickly in one portion to a vigorously stirred suspension of pyromellitic dianhydride (273 mg, 1.25 mmol) and p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (476 mg, 2.5 mmol) in glacial AcOH (10 mL) at room temperature. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour under Ar atmosphere. Later, the mixture was refluxed until a homogenous solution was obtained and the stirring was continued for additional 3 hours, after which the homogenous solution had transformed into a suspension. |

The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 72 hours. The solvent was then filtered through a disposable syringe filter and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain a red solid product. A small amount of methanol was added and the suspension was sonicated at room temperature for 30 minutes and filtered thereafter. The filter cake was washed with additional methanol followed by a portion of diethyl ether and dried in air. The crude cage 1c was purified by HPLC using CH2Cl2/i-PrOH (7:3) as eluent to afford a pure sample of 1c as a red solid (14 mg) in 18%. | Benzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde | None                            | Diamine 2c | Compound 4c (300 mg, 0.382 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of CH2Cl2/TFA (50 ml, 1:1 v/v) and the resulting solution was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The red solid was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (200 mL) and a saturated aq. NaHCO3 solution (200 mL) was added. The resulting suspension was stirred for 16 hours at room temperature. The organic layer was separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 ℅ 100 mL). The organic layers were combined, dried with Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure to get 2c as pure red solid (194 mg) in 87%. |

Thus, de-veloping robust C 2H6-selective adsorbents with highC2H6capacity and C 2H6/C2H4selectivity is urgentlyneeded for industrial applications. In this study, wehave successfully designed and synthesized two nov-el calix[4]resorcinarene-based porous organic cages(POCs) named CPOC-501 and CPOC-502. The POCswere formed via a Schiff-base reaction involvingface-directed [6+8] condensation between a bowl-shaped tetratopic tetraformylcalix[4]resorcinareneand triangular tritopic amine synthons. Analysisusing single crystal X-ray crystallography revealedthat both cages possess large truncated octahedralcavities with a volume of approximately 6500 ?3and12 accessible rhombic windows with a side length ofapproximately 10.5 ?. Furthermore, the cages exhib-ited excellent chemical stability under neutral, acidic,and basic conditions and high Brunauer 每Emmett 每Teller speci ?c surface areas of up to 2175 m2g?1afterdesolvation. Both POCs demonstrated superioradsorption capabilities for C 2H6over C 2H4. Notably,CPOC-502 exhibited a C 2H6capacity and C 2H6/C2H4selectivity of 83 cm3g?1and 2.83, respectively,surpassing most of the best-performing C 2H6-selec-tive porous organic materials reported to date.",affiliation

Notably, this kind of [6+8] octahedral arrange-ment has only been reported in coordination cagesystems71and has not yet been observed in organic cagesin the Cambridge Structural Database.72CPOC-501 andCPOC-502 had a void volume of approximately 6500 ?3,calculated using Voidoo,73,74and an inner diameter ( din)of around 3.3 nm. This places them among the largestpurely organic cages, such as the cubic [8+12] salicyli-mine cage with a dinof 3.3 nm, the [6+12] octahedralCPOC-303 with a dinof 3.9 nm, and the [12+24] porphyrincages with a dinof 4.3 nm.60,75,76There are 12 accessiblerhombic windows with a side length of approximately10.5 ? in both CPOC-501 andCPOC-502 , which are thedistances between the centers of C4RA ＊s phenyl ring andthose of TAPB and TAPT. The pore window to the cavityhas a diameter of approximately 7.5 ?, providing suf ?-cient space for gas molecules to enter the cavity. Thesolid-state packing of CPOC-501 suggests that eachsingle cage is closely surrounded by six neighboringcages, forming an ef ?cient packing. The cage cavitiesare connected through the windows, creating open chan-nels along the a,b, and caxes (Figure 1candSupportingInformation Figures S12 and S13 ).

DOI: 10.31635/ccschem.024.202303625Link to VoR: https://doi.org/10.31635/ccschem.024.2023036251IntroductionEthylene (C 2H4), the primary feedstock in the petro-chemical industry, is predominantly produced throughsteam cracking of petroleum-based feedstocks, resultingin ethane (C 2H6) as the major byproduct.1每3In industrialsettings, the traditional method for removing C 2H6fromthe C 2H4/C2H6mixture involves large distillation towersoperating under low-temperature and high-pressureconditions.4This process consumes a signi ?cant amountof energy, making exploring alternative and more ef ?-cient C 2H4puri?cation methods imperative. Among thevarious technologies available, adsorption and separa-tion utilizing porous adsorbents have shown promise dueto their low energy consumption. Two types of porousadsorbents are used for C 2H6/C2H4separation: C 2H4-selective and C 2H6-selective porous materials.5每7The for-mer relies on introducing open metal sites or highly polargroups into the pores for effective separation,8每10whilethe latter involves creating nonpolar/inert-pore surfaceswith aromatic or aliphatic moieties.11每13However, C 2H6-selective porous materials often suffer from low capacityand poor selectivity compared to C 2H4-selective materi-als due to their lack of suitable binding sites. Neverthe-less, C 2H6-selective adsorbents offer the advantage ofdirectly providing C 2H4in a single adsorption step, elimi-nating the need for an additional energy-intensivedesorption step. This simpli ?es the separation processand can save nearly 40% of energy consumption.14Thus,there is a strong justi ?cation for developing C 2H6-selective adsorbents with exceptional C 2H6/C2H4sepa-ration performance (high C 2H6capacity and selectivity)and long-lasting durability. Metal 每organic frameworks(MOFs) have been extensively investigated for one-stepC2H6/C2H4separation.15每20However, research on purelyporous organic materials (POMs) with a metal-free com-position and native nonpolar/inert pore surfaces, whichare potential candidates as C 2H6-selective adsorbents, isstill in its early stages.21每23Porous organic cages (POCs) are an emerging class ofPOMs that are constructed by covalently linking purelyorganic synthons into zero-dimensional (0D) discretemacromolecules with permanent intrinsic cavities.24每27With their 0D nature, POCs possess inherent advantagessuch as solution processing, easy regeneration, and pre-cise modi ?cation.28每30In 2009, Cooper et al.31publishedthe?rst investigation on tetrahedral [4+4] imine-linked(C=N) POCs for gas sorption, achieving a remarkableBrunauer 每Emmett 每Teller (BET) surface area of up to624 m2g?1. Since then, the design and synthesis of POCswith different condensation modes, shapes, sizes, andfunctions have seen substantial growth.32每43However, thenumber of POCs reported is still much fewer than that ofMOFs and covalent organic framework materials.44每49Despite over a decade of continuous efforts, the reportedPOCs mainly exhibit BET values of less than 1000 m2g?1for the limiting cage size, with the exception of cuboc-tahedral [8+12] boronic ester-linked (B 每O) POC reportedby Mastalerz and coworkers,50which reached a BET valueexceeding 3000 m2g?1. However, increasing the size oforganic cages often results in porosity loss or reductionduring desolvation, leading to structure collapse and/orimproper packing.51,52In addition, most reported POCsare assembled through dynamic and reversible imine andboronic ester bonds,53每55which are susceptible to hydro-lysis under humid conditions, resulting in skeleton col-lapse. These challenges signi ?cantly limit the scope ofPOCs ＊research, highlighting the urgent need to explorelarge, robust POCs to expand their applications.",surface area
"The permanent porosity of desolvated CPOC-501 andCPOC-502 was con ?rmed through N 2gas sorptionexperiments conducted at 77 K. As shown in Figure 3,the isotherms of both cages exhibit the typical type Iadsorption behavior. According to the BET model(Supporting Information Figures S16 and S17 ), the sur-face area of CPOC-501 is 1832 m2g?1, while that of CPOC-502 is 2175 m2g?1. Similarly, the Langmuir model(Supporting Information Figures S18 and S19 ) estimatesthe surface areas to be 2221 m2g?1forCPOC-501 and2747 m2g?1forCPOC-502 . These results demonstrate thesubstantial in ?uence of the solid-state packing style onthe cage surface areas, given the closely matched cagevolumes of both CPOCs. The pore-size distribution (PSD)was determined using the density functional theory mod-el. According to Zeo++ software,80the PSD values forCPOC-501 (‵1.85 nm) and CPOC-502 (‵1.94 nm) corre-late with the calculated largest pore diameters of 1.94and 1.99 nm, respectively.",surface area
"These dimensions render them among the largest POCsreported to date. Importantly, their crystal structuresrepresent the ?rst examples of [6+8] POCs determinedby X-ray diffraction. The exceptional chemical stabilityexhibited by these cages in various aqueous, acidic, andbasic conditions can be attributed to the multivalencesresulting from multiple amine bonds via keto-enaminetautomerization. Notably, CPOC-501 andCPOC-502 dis-play an impressive surface area of up to 2175 m2g?1andexhibit a pronounced preference for adsorbing C 2H6overC2H4. The C 2H6/C2H4selectivities observed in thesecages reach remarkable values of up to 2.83, which pre-sents one of the highest in reported POMs. Moreover, wehave conducted breakthrough experiments to validatethe practical performance of these POCs. The resultsdemonstrate the capability of CPOC-501 and CPOC-502 to effectively separate C 2H4from C 2H6/C2H4gasmixtures in a single adsorption step, yielding high-purityC2H4(>99.9%). Furthermore, these POCs exhibit excel-lent recyclability, maintaining their separation ef ?ciencyfor up to six cycles without deterioration. Moreover, theCPOCs can be prepared easily under mild reaction con-ditions and separated easily in considerably high yields.",surface area

However, another directional-bonding ap-proach, face-directed [6+8] condensation employingtetratopic and tritopic synthons (Scheme 1b), can alsobe employed to construct octahedral cages.68,69Withthis in mind, we employed 1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl)ben-zene (TAPB) and 2,4,6-tris(4-aminophenyl)-1,3,5-triazine(TAPT) tritopic synthons in combination with C4RACHOto synthesize face-directed [6+8] octahedral POCs,namely CPOC-501 and CPOC-502 (Scheme 1c). BothPOCs possess a large truncated octahedral cavity with12 guest-accessible windows and exhibit excellent stabil-ity under acidic and basic conditions and high porosityafter desolvation. Intriguingly, both cages preferredadsorbing C 2H6over C 2H4, as con ?rmed by break-through experiments. These cages directly producedpolymer-grade C 2H4from a mixture of C 2H6and C 2H4in a single adsorption step while demonstrating excep-tional recyclability.",topology

To a cooled (0 ∼C) solution of propane-1,3-diamine (54.4 mg, 1.58 eq) and DMF (1 drop as internal NMR standard) in DCM (50 mL) was added by syringe pump a solution of benzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde (75.2 mg, 1.0 eq) in DCM (40 mL) over 24 h. The resultant mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and maintained for 72 h to afford a turbid solution. Completion of the reaction was confirmed by 1H NMR. Mass spectrometry (MS) and NMR data were obtained directly by in situ sampling of the reaction mixtures. All attempts at isolating the product resulted in significant amounts of insoluble materials being formed. Yields were therefore calculated by use of an internal standard (DMF), which was added to the solution of the aldehyde in DCM prior to addition of the amine. Integrals associated with the aldehyde (-CH=O, 10.22 ppm), before addition, and the imine  (-CH=N, 8.14 and 8.22 ppm for CC-propane and CC-butane respectively), at reaction completion, were normalized against the standard to determine the proportion of cage in solution once the reaction was complete. Insoluble material was assumed not to be product. The in situ NMR showed clean, single product with the expected [2+3] stoichiometry, with integration relative to DMF demonstrating a yield of 24 %. The remainder of the product was an insoluble polymer. m/z = 439.3 (M+H+); 1H NMR: (400 MHz, CDCl3) 汛 ppm 2.41 (quin, J = 5.0 Hz, 2 H) 3.89 (t, J = 5.0 Hz, 4 H) 7.79 (s, 3 H) 8.14 (s, 3 H).",comprehensive synthesis

 ?Attempts at purifying the material by filtration resulted in the material becoming insoluble on isolation. Concentrating the material and then slowly evaporating the solvent also resulted in insoluble material being formed.   We also attempted to adjust the solvent environment post-synthesis: To a colorless, cooled (0 ∼C) solution of 1,3,5-triformylbenzene (450 mg) in dichloromethane (100 mL) was added, under nitrogen, a solution of 1,3-propanediamine (309 mg) in dichloromethane (130 mL) over 18 h to afford a colorless solution. The resultant mixture was maintained for 120 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure (1/2 volume) and diluted with methanol, this procedure being repeated three times to afford a clear, colorless solution in which was suspended an off-white solid. This material was found to be insoluble in chloroform after isolation by filtration.  Finally, we attempted to isolate the material by slow crystallisation. Here, samples (prepared by taking the solutions of DMF-internal-standard experiments) were dissolved in DCM, filtered, and placed in 3 dram vials. These were placed into 10 dram vials, to which was subsequently added MeOH, EtOAc, CHCl3, IPA, Et2O, iPr2O, EtOH, acetone, THF, hexane, MeCN or Toluene: The table below shows the results of these attempts at isolation.

The resultant mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and maintained for 120 h to afford a clear, light-yellow solution. Solvents were removed under reduced pressure to afford a pale yellow solid (875 mg, 100 %).

The variation in cage size is a typicalexample of ＆emergent behavior ＊, since the trends observed arenot simply intuitive. For instance, a small change in the diaminestructure from 1,2-cyclopentane diamine to 1,2-cyclohexanediamine directs the product from a highly porous [4 + 6] cage17to a nonporous and much larger [8 + 12] cage.26We have notyet observed any clear dependence on the choice of reactionsolvent, but Warmuth et al. demonstrated variation betweenthree di ?erent imine cage sizes that depend on solvent choiceas well as ligand geometry.",topology
"23Here, we synthesize a series of imine cages with increasingalkanediamine chain length (see reaction scheme, Figure 1),and examine the e ?ect on the cage size. We then usecomputational methods to rationalize the observed trend andshow that it is possible to predict the size and 3D structure ofthese cages accurately. Previously, the [4 + 6] cage, CC1, wasprepared via the condensation reaction of 1,3,5-triformylben-zene with 1,2-ethanediamine.",topology
"To examine the relative energies of the potential n[2 + 3]combinations and the associated conformers of these cages,models for each precursor combination were built in both a [2+ 3] and [4 + 6] ratio, assuming initially a similar geometry tothat observed in earlier cages synthesized by our group. TheOPLS all-atom force ?eld28was used, since this wasparametrized for organic systems with a focus on conformerenergetics, intermolecular energies, and thermodynamic prop-erties. OPLS was found to perform well at reproducingpreviously reported imine cage structures and energetics (seeSI, Section 2.2 and Figure S6 for validation and testing of thismethodology). Next, we used the MacroModel conformersearching tool to search for all the low-energy conformers ofeach structure, using the low-mode sampling method,29followed by re ?nement of the lowest energy conformationsusing dispersion-corrected DFT. The conformer generationand re ?nement were coupled with an automated procedure tocheck for conformations with an internal ＆pore ＊,d e?ned here asa spherical void with a radius of >2.5 ?.",topology
"Our synthetic experiments showed a clear alternation in thecage size with increasing alkanediamine chain length. Diamineswith an even number of carbon atoms all formed a [4 + 6] cage,while those with an odd number formed a [2 + 3] cage, ascon?rmed in each case by mass spectrometry (SI Section 1 andTable 1 for the molecular ion masses). Single crystal X-raydi?raction structures for the [4 + 6] cage CC18and, here, forthe new CC-pentane cage, are also consistent with this odd/even alternation rule.30Odd?even e ?ects are well-known for n-alkanes and theirderivatives,31with alternating patterns observed in properties,such as melting point.32An odd ?even e ?ect arising from thechain conformation is also observed for n-alkane assembly intomonolayers on surfaces33and in the formation of di ?erentnetwork topologies,34but to our knowledge this is the ?rstexample of this e ?ect in macrocyclic organic cage compounds.",topology

This insensitivity to solvent suggests that thealternating preference for [2 + 3] and [4 + 6] cage structuresis intrinsic and outweighs any in ?uence of solvent stabilizationenergies. With the exception of CC1, which can be eitherporous or nonporous depending on its solid-state polymorph,35no permanent porosity was observed in any other the othersolid materials isolated here.",topology
"These initial screening calculations were designed to identifythe most likely reaction product formed in solution, rather thanthe solid-state structure. Therefore, we only compared theenergies of [4 + 6] conformations that possess an internalcavity, ignoring those that are ※collapsed §and that hence lack apore. We chose this approach because the cages are formedinitially in solution with solvent molecules inside the cages thatcan act as sca ?olds. For example, in a previous study for a cagemolecule that collapses, we observed a cage cavity in the solvatestructure which was lost upon desolvation:26indeed, thatmaterial contained so much solvent that it was akin to a＆solution-phase ＊single crystal structure. Here, we de ?ned a＆pore ＊as being present if the spherical radius of the cavity waslarger than 2.5 ?, which is su ?cient to encapsulate any of thesolvents used here (SI, Section 2.5).

"The lowest energy combination calculated for each moleculewas found to be [4 + 6] for CC1 (?61 kJ mol?1) and CC-butane (?37 kJ mol?1), and [2 + 3] for CC-propane (?21 kJmol?1) and CC-pentane (?48 kJ mol?1) (Figure 1). Theenergies given in parentheses here are expressed as relativeenergy per [2 + 3] unit with respect to the alternative cage size.Hence, these calculations match the experimental observationof an odd ?even e ?ect. Table S3 gives the relative energies forall the low-energy conformers, and Figure S9 gives thestructures for the lowest energy conformer for eachstoichiometry. The energetically preferred ＆in?ated ＊structuresare all shown in Figure 1. For CC1, only one low-energyconformer (de ?ned as lying within 20 kJ mol?1of the minimumenergy conformer and ignoring mirror images) was found forthe hypothetical [2 + 3] combination. However, twoconformers, one with Tand one with C3symmetry, werefound for the [4 + 6] case. Both of these conformers werepreviously observed in a dichloromethane solvate of CC1, butonly the lowest energy Tconformer was seen in the desolvatedCC1 solid (Figure 2).35For the longer chain diamines, therewere often several low-energy conformers, typically di ?eringonly by small torsional di ?erences in the alkane chains. Forboth of the [2 + 3] cages, the imine groups of the two aryl facesare aligned in the lowest energy [2 + 3] conformation, such thatthey have a C3axis running through the centers of the arenerings.",topology
"As for the origin of this odd/even alternation, the [2 + 3]CC1 cage is energetically disfavored because the ethane linkeris simply too short to separate the aryl cage faces withoutunfavorable distortion of the arenes. For cages with longeralkane chains, it appears that the self-assembly is directedtoward structures that allow a staggered anti conformation inthe alkane chain, resulting in the nitrogen atoms beingstaggered gauche with respect to each other in the [4 + 6]molecules or in an eclipsed con ?guration in the [2 + 3]molecules (Table 1).",topology
"An examination of the conformations allows us to commenton the molecules ＊shape persistence. All of the [4 + 6]molecules, with the exception of CC1, have low-lying collapsedconformations, possibly because of the easy rotation aboutalkane chain conformations (Figure S9). This explains theexperimental observation that the other [4 + 6] cage, CC-butane , is non-porous and is not stable to desolvation. Thecomparison of computed energies for ＆porous ＊,i n?atedconformers and alternative non-porous, ＆collapsed ＊conformersgives us a methodology to screen in silico for new intrinsicallyporous cages.

Conformer searching method We used the MacroModel (version 9.9, Schr?dinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2011) conformer searching tool to search for all the low-energy conformers for each structure.	
 ?We first validated that this approach finds known alternative conformers for published organic cage systems, and that it gives reasonable relative energies by examining case studies from other imine cages that we have reported previously (see Section 2.4). The procedure uses a low-mode (LMOD)8 sampling approach which follows the low frequency eigenvectors of the molecule. This has been used previously to examine cyclic alkanes. We used 50,000 search steps for [2+3] molecules and 500,000 steps for the larger [4+6] molecules. The maximum and minimum move distances were 3 and 12 ?, with all structures within an energy window of 50 kJ mol-1 of the lowest energy structure being retained. This number of steps was chosen because repeats of the calculations found no new low energy structures, with each conformation sampled multiple times within an individual run. For geometry optimization, the convergence criterion was a remaining RMS force of 0.05 kJ mol-1 ?-1. These cages can often exist in two alternative enantiomers (R and S) related by helical chirality:9 since these have equivalent energies, we only retained one mirror-image conformer. We used an automated procedure (Section 2.5) to check for conformations with an internal ＆pore＊, defined here as a spherical space with a radius of >2.5 ?. If none was found, then we repeated the search with an additional 250,000 steps and a search window of 500 kJ mol-1 in order to see whether any structures with an internal void could be found lying higher in energy.  We applied a final refinement of the structures and energies by optimizing the resulting molecular structures with DFT-D3 calculations performed in CP2K10 with the PBE functional,11 TZVP-MOLOPT basis sets,12 GTH-type pseudopotential,13 a plane wave grid cutoff of 400 Ry, a cubic box of length 50 ?, and the Grimme-D3 dispersion correction.14 This procedure was applied to any structure within 25 kJ mol-1 of the lowest energy conformer, which we determined as the maximum error in the

 ?energy difference between structures for the OPLS force field (see Section 2.3). We have previously used this DFT setup to reliably reproduce the structure and energetics of porous imine cages in both the solid state3,15 and as single molecules and dimer pairs.4,16   2.2. Performance of OPLS forcefield for porous organic imine cages Many of the commonly available, transferable forcefields perform poorly at reproducing the structures of porous organic imine cages, either because they do not contain the relevant parameters for, or are poorly parameterized for, the angles and torsions around the imine bond. Hence, optimization of the cage molecules by these forcefields, such as UFF5,17 and PCFF6,18, severely distorts the tetrahedral structure of the cages upon minimization. However, upon testing the OPLS all-atom forcefield (Optimized Potentials for Liquid Simulations),7,19 it performed very well at reproducing both the molecular structures and molecular energies of a range of known imine cages. The OPLS forcefield was developed for organic and biomolecular systems, with the focus on fitting being the energetics of conformers, intermolecular gas phase energies and testing against thermodynamic properties of pure organic liquids, particularly heats of vaporization and densities.  We took single cage molecules from the single crystal X-ray structures of several published imine cages that were also formed using 1,3,5-triformyl benzene: CC2 (1,2-propylenediamine)8,20, CC3 (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)10,20, CC4 (1,2-diaminocyclopentane),11,21 and CC9 (1,2-diphenylethylenediamine)12,22. All of these cages have a [4+6] ratio of aldehyde to amine precursors. We then geometry optimized these isolated cage molecules using OPLS-2005 using Macromodel, part of the Schrodinger software package (MacroModel, version 9.9, Schr?dinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2011), until the remaining force was less than 0.05 kJ ?-1 mol-1. Figure S6 shows overlays of the molecular structure from the X-ray data and the OPLS minimized structures. The structures are very well reproduced, in particular the core cage structures. The root mean square displacements, including hydrogens, are 0.072 ? (CC3), 0.142 ? (CC4) and 0.206 ? (CC9). The CC2 structure cannot be compared in this quantitative fashion due to the disorder in the methyl positions across the two possible vertex positions in the single crystal X-ray diffraction structure. There is some small difference in the cyclopentane vertices of CC4, but these are disordered in the crystal structure in any case. There are also some differences in the phenyl group torsions on the vertices of CC9, where there is presumably facile rotation and a flat potential energy surface. The latter is not considered to be a problem because this type of fragment is not present in the new alkanediamine cage molecules examined here, although this could become an important consideration in building a more generic methodology. Finally, from previous DFT+D calculations on the molecular structures, the two lowest energy CC1 conformers (with T and C3 symmetry, respectively) were found to lie 13 kJ mol-1 apart9,13. Geometry optimized structures of these two molecules in OPLS were found to lie 15 kJ mol-1 apart, a good agreement with this DFT value. Taken in combination, these results gave us confidence that OPLS could be used for the reliable description of both the 3-D structures and the relative energies of the new organic cages reported in the main text.

Relative energies of OPLS and DFT In order to select which band of low-energy structures from the OPLS conformer search to refine using PBE/TZVP-MOLOPT DFT+D3 calculations, it was first necessary to establish a confidence level in the forcefield. By determining the maximum magnitude of the energetic reordering of the structures from OPLS to DFT calculations, it can be ensured that the ＆true＊ lowest energy structure is not missed because it lies too far above the lowest energy OPLS structure. To do this, the energies of the [2+3] and [4+6] molecules formed from 1,3,5-triformylbenzene (TFB) and 1,5-diaminopentane were compared from both OPLS and DFT calculations. The results are shown in Figure S6 and Tables S1 and S2. These data show that there is some reordering of the relative energies of the structures, with the absolute numbers being fairly small. For the [2+3] structures, the maximum change in relative energy was found to be 8.2 kJ mol-1, and for the [4+6] structures, the maximum change was 11.4 kJ mol-1. On this basis, the confidence level in the forcefield was determined to be 20 kJ mol-1. Hence, for all systems, all structures from the OPLS conformer search that were within 20 kJ mol-1 of the lowest energy structure were reoptimized in DFT calculations in order to find the final, lowest energy conformer.",topology

Validation of conformer searching approach for porous organic cages To validate the conformer searching procedure, several test case studies were identified, based on porous imine cages that have been reported previously. These test cases were: i) CC1 每 there are two alternative T symmetry [4+6] cage molecules (enantiomers labeled R and S have helical chirality); these enantiomers, of course, have the same energy. There is an additional C3 conformer that lies by ~13 kJ mol-1 higher in energy.9,14 ii) CC5 每 there are two alternative T symmetry [4+6] cage molecules (R and S enantiomers, again isoenergetic); the lowest energy structure is expected to be !15$!10$!5$0$5$10$15$Rela%ve'energy'(kJ/mol21)'[2+3]'Conf1$in?ated$Conf2$in?ated$Conf3$in?ated$Conf4$in?ated$Conf5$in?ated$!15$!10$!5$0$5$10$15$Rela%ve'energy'(kJ'mol21)'[4+6]'Conf1$in?ated$Conf2$in?ated$Conf3$in?ated$Conf4$in?ated$Conf5$in?ated$

 ?shape-persistent with a cavity, as exemplified by the highly porous nature of the bulk material for this cage.15 iii) CC7 每 this is a large [8+12] cage molecule with a shape (in its solvate form) of a rhombicuboctahedral capsule, and a lower energy ※collapsed§ structure that lacks a permanent internal cavity, demonstrating that this cage, unlike CC1 and CC5, is not shape persistent.23  The conformer searching procedure outlined in the main text was carried out on structural models built from the relevant precursors (that is, not taken from single crystal X-ray diffraction data) in order to replicate our approach for the new molecules synthesized in this study, and to reflect the procedure that would be used for a hypothetical molecule that has not yet been synthesized. For these systems, only 15,000 steps were used in the conformer searching procedure. In brief, the results were as follows:  i) For CC1, both of the tetrahedral enantiomers were found with the same energy (to within a fraction of a kJ mol-1). In addition, another conformer was found with C3 symmetry, where some of the Carene-Carene-Cimine-Nimine torsions were flipped by 180∼, which lay 13 kJ mol-1 higher in energy than the T conformers as calculated in OPLS. Both conformers were excellent matches with the relevant single crystal X-ray diffraction structures, and no lower-lying ＆collapsed＊ structures were found, validating the known shape-persistence for CC1.  ii) For CC5, the tetrahedral enantiomers were again found as the lowest energy structures, with the next conformer lying 15 kJ mol-1 higher in energy; this had a similar structure, with small rotations of the phenyl groups of the triphenylamine cage face. Again, this molecule was correctly determined to be shape-persistent and no low energy ※collapsed§ structures were found.   iii) For CC7, the lowest energy conformer was found to be a collapsed structure with no internal cavity. More than 100 kJ mol-1 higher in energy (by OPLS) was found the rhombicuboctahedral capsule structure, which was observed in single X-ray crystal diffraction data for the solvated molecule. This is in agreement with the observed lack of shape-persistence for this larger cage, which collapses upon desolvation.  In summary, this conformational searching approach with OPLS successfully reproduces the desired structures, relative energies, and experimental shape-persistence (or lack of) for all three case studies.  2.5 Identifying conformations that contain an internal void: screening for shape-persistence In order to automatically determine whether the various conformations found during the conformer searches for [4+6] molecules contained an internal void, we wrote a PERL script to determine the largest sphere that could fit within the center of the cage. First, the center of mass of each molecule was calculated, and then the shortest distance between this center of mass and any atom of the molecule was determined. This distance, minus the van der Waals radius of the atom (C = 1.7 ?, H = 1.2 ?, and N = 1.55 ?), was then defined as being the radius of the largest sphere that can fit 	
 ?S12	
 ?within the cage molecule. A molecule was then deemed to have an internal void if this radius was greater than 2.5 ?. This is equivalent to the cage molecule being able to encapsulate small guests such as H2, N2, CO2, Xe, and common organic solvents.   The measured void radius for CC1 here is 2.76 ? (Table S4), and this cage is known to encapsulate solvents such as dichloromethane and ethylacetate24. Hence, since all the ※inflated§ conformations for the other cage molecules studied here have a void larger than this, it seems reasonable to assume that the solvents used here (methanol, DCM, ethyl acetate, ethanol and chloroform) are able to act as scaffolds for any of these structures.",topology

Inspired by highly stable sp2carbon-conjugated (C=C) covalent organic frame-works, we used rational design and synthesizedthe?rst family of sp2carbon-linked POCs (sp2c-POCs) with triangular prism shapes by a one-stepKnoevenagel reaction that is a high yield [2+3] con-densation reaction. The stability of sp2c-POC wasdemonstrated under strenuous conditions involvingfor example concentrated HCl or saturated NaOHsolution. sp2c-POC was used as a robust adsorbentfor ef ?cient separation of CO 2/CH 4or CO 2/N2mixtures.

The SCXRD analysis revealed thatsp2c-POC1 crystallizes in a monoclinic system with spacegroup P-21c and has a distorted triangular prism structurewith two molecules of i-Bu-C3CHO acting as planes withheight (the distance between the centers of oppositearomatic rings) of 1.15 nm and three Me-BDN moleculesacting as the edges (Figure 1d). Interestingly, the linkageinsp2c-POC1 is the sp2C=C bond, and its backbonetherefore contains only carbon atoms. To the best of ourknowledge, POCs with pure carbon atom backbones areuncommon,31and most such POCs reported so far aresynthesized by kinetic bond formation and alkynemetathesis reactions, which are accompanied by pro-blems involving expensive catalysts and/or low productyields.25,55,56Further inspecting the structure of sp2c-POC1revealed that its backbone is comprised of all sp2carbons,which suggests that Knoevenagel reaction is an effectiveway to prepare fully sp2c羽-conjugated cages. Althoughseveral methods, such as Wittig reaction, Suzuki 每Miyauracross-couplings together with acid-mediated reductivearomatization, and reductive elimination of the platinumfrom the coordination cage, have been reported, but theyrequire low-yielding multistep synthesis under tough con-ditions.57每59The intrinsic void diameter and average diam-eter of the circular window of the cage reported by thepyWINDOW program are ‵5.6 and ‵4.8 ?, respectively.",CCDC

Theanalyses of the crystalline void of sp2c-POC1 by Mercurysoftware and placing a probe of N 2with kinetic radius of1.82 ? revealed that 22% of the unit cell volume is emptyspace large enough to hold gas molecules ( SupportingInformation Figure S24 ). Moreover, we also exploredwhether the reticular chemistry can be applied in con-struction of sp2c-POCs. Thus, the longer ditopic V-shapeddiacetonitriles linkers were used in reacting with i-Bu-C3CHO, which directly produced the corresponding larg-er [2+3] sp2c-POC2 (CCDC No. 2225780) with intrinsicvoid diameter, height, and cavity volume increased to1.2 nm, 1.7 nm, and 566 ?3, respectively (Figure 1e).

Thus, we used CO 2ad-sorption at 196 K as an alternative method to probe theirporosity.64This phenomenon is relatively common in po-rous molecular organic materials, such as hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks, supramolecular organicframeworks, and POCs.65每67Their 196 K CO 2saturationcapacities ranged from 68.7 to 152.3 cm3g?1, giving acorresponding calculated Brunauer 每Emmett 每Teller (BET)surface area ranging from 185 to 350 m2g每1(Figure 3aandSupporting Information Figures S30 每S34). Notably, sp2c-POC1 exhibited the highest BET surface area among thesesp2c-POCs, suggesting the solid-state packing has a largein?uence on their surface areas ( Supporting InformationFigures S24 每S28 and Table S5 ). In terms of the mostuseful gas adsorption property, sp2c-POC1 was selectedas a representative to study its sorption of various gasesat different temperatures, as well as analytical applica-tions. At 298 K and 100 kPa, sp2c-POC1 absorbed signi ?-cant quantities of gases with the exception of N 2,w i t huptake capacities of 27.4 and 6.1 cm3g?1for CO 2and CH 4(Figure 3b), respectively. Moreover, it absorbed about35 cm3g?1of C2 hydrocarbons at 273 K and 100 kPa(Supporting Information Figure S36 ). These sorption dataare comparable to those derived from the reported POMswith narrow pores.68Notably, the CO 2uptake capacitiesofsp2c-POC1 were much higher than those of theconcave-shaped aromatic trialdehyde precursor, whoseCO2uptake is only about 1.1 cm3g?1(Supporting Infor-mation Figure S37 ). This result reveals that bridging mo-lecular synthons with intrinsic cavities leading into cagescan possess highly enhanced gas storage abilities. More-over, the gas sorption isotherms of CO 2,C H 4,a n dN 2at273 K were investigated to calculate the correspondingisosteric heat of adsorption ( Qst) values for these gases(Supporting Information Figures S38 每S41).",surface area

"Experimental MethodsThe phenylacetonitriles, organic solvents, and inorganicand organic bases obtained from commercial sourceswere employed without further puri ?cation. The longerditopic V-shaped diacetonitriles were prepared by Suzukicross-coupling reactions between substituted 1,3-dibro-mobenzene and 2-(4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxabor-olan-2-yl)phenyl)acetonitrile. The substituted aromatictrialdehydes were synthesized through 1,3,5-tris(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzene and relatedsubstituted 3-bromobenzaldehydes by Suzuki reactions(Supporting Information Figures S4 每S15). All sp2c-POCcrystals can be directly obtained through Knoevenagelcondensation between substituted aromatic trialdehydes(1 equiv) and diacetonitriles (1.5 equiv) with Cs 2CO3ascatalyst and common organic solvents such as tetrahy-drofuran (THF), methanol (MeOH), and toluene, by sol-vothermal method.

"Conformer-1 and -2, with different cleft positions and sizes. Aided by molecular dynamicssimulations, we select two triamino conformation capturers (denoted CC). Small-sized CC-1 selectively capture Conformer-1 by matching its cleft size, while the large-sized CC-2 is ableto match and capture both conformers. This strategy allows the formation of three com-pounds with twin cavities, which we coin diphane. The self-assembly of diphane units resultsin superstructures with tunable proton conductivity, which reaches up to 1.37℅10-5Sc m-1.https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-26397-3 OPEN1School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Frontiers Science Center for Transformative Molecules, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 800 Dongchua nRoad, 200240 Shanghai, China.2School of Physical Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, 393 Huaxia Middle Road, 200120 Shanghai, China.",affiliation

"S23 The difference of thermodynamic stability of all diphanes were also studied by DFT calculation (B3LYP-D3 in PCM with chloroform as solvent), which is summarized in Supplementary Fig. 11. The strain energy (SE), torsion angle and relative configuration energy were computed to evaluate the possibility of forming a cage structure. SE is defined as the energy difference between the conformer in the cage and the optimized free conformer. It should be noted the end group of the conformers in the cage was reduced to aldehyde structures to maintain the equality of the calculations. The SE of exo-[1,2,4]diphane is the highest with 102.13 kJ mol-1, larger than 96.38 kJ mol-1 for endo-[1,2,4]diphane, and exo-[1,2,4]diphane is significantly bent with the smallest torsion angle of t4 = 174.12o, smaller than 175.04o for endo-[1,2,4]diphane. When using the large-sized CC-2, the SE values of the resulting diphanes are considerably lower, with 67.33 kJ mol-1 for endo-[1,2,5]diphane, and 77.00 kJ mol-1 for exo-[1,2,5]diphane, respectively, echoed with their corresponding torsion angles. The SE difference between endo-[1,2,4]diphane and exo-[1,2,4]diphane therefore presumably leads to the formation of the former as the major product. Considering no formation of exo-[1,2,4]diphane was observed while its SE is only slightly higher than that of endo-[1,2,4]diphane, we assume that a threshould effect might play a significant role that determines the formation of diphanes in the current study. The tendency of SE and torsion angle for endo-[1,2,4]diphane vs. exo-[1,2,4]diphane and endo-[1,2,5]diphane vs. exo-[1,2,5]diphane is also in line with that of their corresponding configuration energy, as the calculated results showed that endo-[1,2,4]diphane is 51.02 kJ/mol more stable than exo-[1,2,4]diphane, and endo-[1,2,5]diphane is 23.86 kJ/mol more stable than exo-[1,2,5]diphane. All the calculated results correlate well with the experimental yields obtained for the resulting diphanes.   S24 7.

Ltd. 2-Formylbenzeneboronic acid and tris(3-aminopropyl)amine were purchased from Beijing InnoChem Co. Ltd. Sodium tris(acetoxy)hydroborate was purchased from Shanghai Adamas-Beta Co. Ltd. The key intermediates of 1,4-phenylenebis(diphenylmethanol) 1a, 4,4'-(1,4-phenylenebis(diphenylmethylene))dianiline 1b, 1,4-ditritylbenzene 1c, 1,4-bis(tris(4-bromophenyl)methyl)benzene 1d were prepared according to the literature procedure. 1 Tris(4-bromophenyl)methanol 2a was synthesized according to the literature.2 4-(Tris(4-bromophenyl)methyl)phenol 2b was prepared according to the literature.3 All other reagents were bought from commercial sources and used without any purification unless stated. Tetrahydrofuran was dried over sodium/benzophenone under nitrogen atmosphere before use. The reaction evolution was monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and flash column chromatography was performed on silica gel (200-300 mesh) with indicated eluent. 2. Techniques 2.1 Solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Advance ｋ HD (400/500 MHz) NMR spectrometer at room temperature. Proton and carbon chemical shift values (汛) and coupling constants (J) are reported in ppm and Hertz (Hz) respectively. The resonance multiplicity of the 1H NMR spectra are denoted as ※s§ (single), ※d§ (doublet), ※t§ (triplet), ※quint§ (quintet), ※m§ (multiplet) and broad resonances are described as ※br§. Residual protic solvent of CDCl3 (1H, 汛 = 7.26 ppm; 13C, 汛 = 77.16 ppm), (CD3)2SO (1H, 汛 = 2.50 ppm; 13C, 汛 = 39.52 ppm), CD2Cl2 (1H, 汛 = 5.32 ppm; 13C, 汛 = 53.84 ppm), CD3OD (1H, 汛 = 3.31 ppm; 13C, 汛 = 49.00 ppm) were used as the internal standard in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra. S4 2.2 Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) Solid-state 1H MAS single-pulse and DQ/SQ spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE  NE O 600 MHz, 3.2 mm rotor, MAS of 15 MHz, recycle delay of 5 sec. 2.3 Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Paragon 1000 spectrometer at frequencies ranging from 4000 to 500 cm-1 at room temperature. The signal intensity was denoted as ※s§ (strong), ※m§ (medium), ※w§ (weak) and ※br§ (broad). 2.4 Matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) Matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was performed on a solariX XR 7.0 T hybrid quadrupole-FTICR mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI/APCI/MALDI ion source (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The MS instrument was tuned and calibrated with ESI-L low concentration tuning mix (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and sodium formate. The analytical sample was prepared by mixing the reaction mixture (2.0 mg/mL in CHCl3) with the matrix solution (10 mg/mL DCTB in CHCl3) in a v/v ratio of 1/5, and then loaded onto the MALDI plate. The sample on the plate was thoroughly dried prior to analysis. The mass spectra were analyzed using Compass Data Analysis 5.0 (Bruker). 2.5 Single crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD)  The crystals were kept at 170.0 K during data collection. Using Olex24, the structures were solved with the SHELXT5 structure solution program using Intrinsic Phasing and refined with the SHELXL6 refinement package using Least Squares minimisation. Some solvent molecules were highly disordered and could not be reasonably located. The voids in the crystal lattice were treated with Platon squeeze program. S5 2.6 Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) The detailed procedure of sample preparation for PXRD measurements are as follows: The as-synthesized bulk powder samples of diphanes were firstly dispersed in distilled THF solvent with a concentration at 30 mg/mL, followed by sonication until thorough dispersion. Additional TFA was then added until the mixture became clear, which was subsequently subjected to filtration with 0.45 米m PTFE springe filter to remove the undissolved residue. Slow evaporation of the settled solution yielded high-quality single crystals, which were then loaded into a quartz glass capillary with a diameter of 0.7 mm without mother liquor. PXRD data were collected at ambient temperature with a capillary setup. 2.7 High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) HPCL analysis were performed on a Shimadzu LC-20 AD instrument at room temperature using a Daicel Chiralcel IA column. The elution was employed within 60 min with 18% CHCl3 in ethanol containing 0.5% diethylamine of total volume at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The sample concentration was 5.0 mM in methanol, and the injection volume was 10 米L. The absorbance of endo-[1,2,4]diphane was monitored at 254 nm, endo-[1,2,5]diphane and exo-[1,2,5]diphane were monitored at 298 nm. S6 3. Synthesis 3.1 Synthesis route of model molecule 1  Supplementary Fig. 1 Synthesis route of model compound 1. 1,4-Phenylenebis(diphenylmethanol) (1a): The phenyllithium solution (51.4 mL, 51.0 mmol, 5.0 equiv., 1.0 M in ether) in anhydrous THF (70.0 mL) was cooled to -78 ⊥ under argon atmosphere.

"In the present work, we employed directing groups to preciselycontrol the self-assembly products based on imine formation. Thesedirecting groups mediate or determine the conformations of thebuilding blocks, by providing hydrogen bonds with different modes tothe latter. Each of these preorgani zed conformations of the buildingblocks favors one speci ?c cage compound that is produced as thepredominant product. To be more speci ?c, a pseudo-linear tetra-formyl precursor containing two isophthalaldehyde units and trans -cyclohexane-1,2-diamine ( trans -CHDA), which is either enantiomeri-cally pure or the racemic mixture, are combined for self-assembly.Subtle variation in the substituents located in each isophthalaldehyderesidue switches the self-assembly products between two types ofconstitutionally different cage molecules, including a [3 + 6] chiralcage and a [2 + 4] achiral cage. In the case of OH unit whose acid protonacts as a hydrogen bond donor, intramolecular hydrogen bonds drivethe two formyls and/or the resultant imine units on both sides toorientate in an exo-endo conformation. Such conformation favors theproduction of a [3 + 6] chiral cage, which is composed of threeequivalents of the tetraformyl precursor and six equivalents of enan-tiomerically pure trans -CHDA. When the racemic trans -CHDA is used inself-assembly, narcissistic self-sorting occurs, generating a pair ofenantiomers of the [3 + 6] chiral cage each containing only one type ofenantiomer of trans -CHDA. As a comparison, an alkoxy substituentcontaining no acidic protons affords the two formyls and/or imines anexo-exoconformation68. When the tetraformyl precursor is combinedwith the racemic mixture of trans -CHDA in a 1:2 ratio, a meso [2 + 4]cage is produced as the only observable product, which is composedof two equivalents of the tetraformyl precursor and four equivalents ofracemic trans -CHDA. More interestingly, when the substituent is anester unit containing protons with modest acidity, both exo-endo andexo-exoconformations become thermodynamically feasible. The self-assembled products are then determined by the chirality of the bisa-mine precursors. That is, enantiomerically pure and racemic bisaminefavor the [3 + 6] and [2 + 4] products, respectively. Physicochemicalanalysis based on NMR spectroscopic results, solid-state structures, aswell as theoretical calculation results indicated that these self-assembly preferences stem from the self-assembly products attempt-ing to minimize intramolecular steric hindrance, by keeping all theimine protons in the syn conformation69,70relative to the corre-sponding adjacent methine proton in the cyclohexyl unit.",topology
"D. means Not Determined, because either the target molecules were not producedwith observable yields, or the products are generated within a library of mixturewhose1H NMR spectrum is too complicated to determine the corresponding yields.Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-40255-4Nature Communications |         (2023) 14:4627 2spectrum (Fig. 2B) was recorded, in which a set of sharp resonanceswere observed, indicating a product with a symmetrical structure wasobtained as the predominant product. Mass spectrum (SupplementaryFig. 28) indicated that this product is a [3 + 6] product, namely com-posed of three equivalents of 1and six equivalents of ( S,S)-CHDA. Thisproduct is referred to as 13S6.I nt h e1H NMR spectrum (Fig. 2B), each ofthe resonances corresponding to the protons in the isophthalaldehyderesidues, including both the imine e/e＊and the phenyl c/c＊, splits intotwo peaks. This observation indicated that in each isophthalaldehyderesidue, the two imine units have two different orientations, namelyeither exoorendo with respect to the central OH group (Fig. 3B,middle). The framework of 13S6is chiral, resulting from the stereochirality of the ( S,S)-CHDA precursor. The chirality of 13S6was sup-ported by1H NMR spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 29) in which the twoprotons in the methylene fbecome diastereotopic. The solid-statesample of 13S6was obtained by adding MeOH into its solution inchloroform and collecting the precipitate via ?ltration. The solid of13S6was re-dissolved in CDCl 3,w h o s e1H NMR spectrum was essentiallythe same as the before precipitation, indicated that 13S6was ratherkinetically inert and did not undergo observable degradation duringprecipitation and re-dissolving. In the1H NMR spectrum (Fig. 2B) of13S6, a few small broad resonances were observed, indicating thatsome oligomeric or polymeric byproducts were also generated. Thesebroad resonances were not removed, even after we attempted topurify 13S6via precipitation. We thus used NMR yield to quantify theproduction of each cage in this article, by adding an internal standardin the NMR sample. The self-assembly yield of 13S6was determined tobe 60% (Supplementary Fig. 76). The cage 13R6, which is the enantio-mer of 13S6, was also self-assembled in a similar procedure (Supple-mentary Fig. 16C), by condensing 1and ( R,R)-CHDA in CDCl 3.T h ecircular dichroism (CD) spectra (Supplementary Fig. 33B) of both 13S6and 13R6were recorded, showing mirror-like images.

We also combined 1and EDA,which is a less preorganized counterpart of trans -CHDA. Heating themixture in CDCl 3led to the generation of a library of oligomeric andpolymeric precipitates, instead of a putative [3 + 6] cage namely13(EDA) 6. Such results indicate that conformation preorganization isalso of importance in the bisamino precursors.",topology
"In order to strengthen our proposition that the OH group in 1plays a predominant role in favoring the formation of the corre-sponding [3 + 6] cages namely either 13S6or13R6, we synthesized threeanalogs including 0, 2as well as 3, in which the central OH substituentsin1are replaced by other units namely H, alkyloxy and ester respec-tively. The precursor 0can be considered as a counterpart of 1withoutany directing groups. 0and ( S,S)-CHDA were combined in CDCl 3in a1:2 ratio. After heating the corresponding solution at 50 ∼C for 4 h, the1H NMR spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 23A) indicated that an analog of13S6, namely 03S6was produced as the major product, accompaniedwith a [2 + 4] product 02S4as a kinetic product. The formation of both03S6and02S4was convinced by mass spectrometry (SupplementaryFig. 24). Further heating the reaction mixture for 120 h converted most02S4into03S6, as inferred from the observation that the molecular ionpeak corresponding to the [2 + 4] product weakened signi ?cantly(Supplementary Fig. 25). Even heating the solution for no less than120 h, the resonances corresponding to 02S4with small intensity werestill observable in the1H NMR spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 23C),indicating that the conversion from 02S4into03S6was not complete.",topology
"We then combined either 2or3(2.5 mM) with a racemic mixtureoftrans -CHDA in a 1:2 ratio in CDCl 3. After heating at 50 ∼C for 6 h, the1H NMR spectra (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. 48) and mass spectra(Supplementary Figs. 34 and 47) of both solutions were recorded. Massspectrum indicated that in both cases, [2 + 4] products were gener-ated. That is, each product is composed of two equivalents of tetra-formyl precursors (i.e., 2or3) and four equivalents of trans -CHDA,namely either ( S,S)-CHDA or ( R,R)-CHDA.",topology
"When the racemic trans -CHDA was replaced by enantiomeric pure(S,S)-CHDA, self-assembly yielded totally different products. Heating a1:2 mixture of 2(2.5 mM) and ( S,S)-CHDA in CDCl3produced a library ofmixture, whose1H NMR spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 19B) showed aset of irregular resonances. Such observation indicated that theputative chiral cage namely 22S4is not a thermodynamically favoredproduct. The putative cage 22S4can be considered as a chiral coun-terpart of 22R2S2,i nw h i c ht w o( R,R)-CHDA residues are replaced bytwo ( S,S)-CHDA residues. However, in 22S4,f o u ro ft h ee i g h ti m i n eprotons adopt the thermodynamically disfavored anti conformation(Supplementary Fig. 19) with respect to the adjacent methine protons,making its formation less favored. Another putative product, namely23S6, an analog of 13S6, was not observed in either1H NMR spectrum ormass spectrum. This is not surprising, given that the [3 + 6] productsrequire the exo-endo conformation, while the alkyloxy directinggroups in 2,f a v o rt h e exo-exoconformation in contrast.",topology
"To our surprise, combining the tetraaldehyde 3(2.5 mM) and(S,S)-CHDA in CDCl3in a 1:2 ratio yielded a product whose1HNMRspectrum (Fig. 5B) was in reminiscence of the aforementioned [3 + 6]product namely 13S6. Mass spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 57) con ?rmsthat a chiral cage 33S6was self-assembled as the predominant product,whose yield was determined to be 63 % (Supplementary Fig. 81). Asoccurred in 13S6, the resonances corresponding to two imine protonsin33S6also split into two peaks (Fig. 5B), indicating that the two imineswithin each isophthalaldehyde residue adopt an exo-endo conforma-tion. The exo-endo conformation was also supported by the NOESYspectrum (Supplementary Fig. 61) of 33S6. That is, while the endo imineproton e＊undergoes coupling with one phenyl proton c＊in the iso-phthalaldehyde residue, the exoimine proton eundergoes couplingwith the CH 2proton kin the central side chain. The exo-endo con-formation in the case of 33S6was also driven by the formation of twodifferent types of hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3D, middle). That is, onehydrogen bond forms between exoimine proton eand the centraloxygen atom, while the second one forms between the endo iminenitrogen atom and the proton in the methylene unit h/h＊in ethyl unit ofthe ester. The occurrence of the latter hydrogen bonding results fromthe electron-withdrawing inductive effect of the ester oxygen atom,which renders the protons h/h＊relatively acidic. Such relatively acidicprotons are absent in the case of 2containing n-butoxy chains. It istherefore not surprising that 2did not form the putative cage 23S6.T h eoccurrence of CH ?N hydrogen bonding forces in 33S6is supported byits1HNMR spectrum (Fig. 5B), in which the resonances correspondingto the methylene unit h/h＊in the ester split into two peaks, while themethylene unit kexhibits a singlet. In order to further strengthen ourhypothesis that the acidic ester proton plays an important role in cageformation, we thus synthesized another tetraformyl precursor 4(seeits molecular formula in Fig. 1) containing tert-butyl acetate units. 4contains ester functions while does not contain the protons withmodest acidity as those in 3. Combining 4and ( S,S)-CHDA in a 1:2 ratioyielded a library of mixture (Supplementary Fig. 22), instead of 43S6.",topology
"This control experiment unambiguously supported our propositionthat hydrogen bonding involving the ester side chains in 3plays acritical role in favoring the formation of 33S6.A d d i t i o no f( R,R)-CHDAinto 33S6gradually transformed latter into the [2 + 4] achiral cage32R2S2(Fig. 5A). Furthermore, combining a mixture of pre-synthesized33S6and 33R6with a 1:1 ratio also yielded the meso cage 32R2S2.",topology
"DiscussionIn summary, an ingenious approach to precisely control the self-assembly product based on imine condensation is developed, byintroducing different directing groups to favor speci ?c target pro-ducts. When a tetraformyl precursor containing two iso-phthalaldehyde units and trans -CHDA are combined, the self-assemblyproducts are very sensitive to the variation of the central substituentslocated in each isophthalaldehyde residue between two imine units.This is because the central directing groups provide hydrogen bondingwith different modes to imine building blocks located on both sides.These intramolecular forces endow the imine units with speci ?cc o n -formations, each resembling and favoring a speci ?cc a g ep r o d u c tt h a tis produced selectively. To be speci ?c, in the case of OH substituentgroup whose proton is rather acidic, the two imine bonds are pre-organized in an exo-endo conformation, driven by two differenthydrogen bonds in the form of either CH ?Oo rO H ?N. Such con-formation favors the formation of a chiral [3 + 6] cage containingenantiomeric pure trans -CHDA residues. When the substituent groupcontains no acidic protons such as an alkoxyl unit, the two imine bondshave an exo-exoconformation driven by two identical hydrogen bondsnamely CH ?O. Such conformation favors the formation of achiral[2 + 4] cages containing racemic trans -CHDA building blocks as thepredominant product, implying the occurrence of social self-sorting.In the case of ester substituent group containing protons with modestacidity, both the exo-endo and exo-exoconformations are thermo-dynamically feasible. As a consequence, the self-assembly products aresurprisingly determined by the chirality of the trans -CHDA, namelythat enantiomeric pure and racemic trans -CHDA favor the [3 + 6] and[2 + 4] products respectively. Such preference results from a tendencythat the imine protons attempt to adopt the synconformation relativeto the adjacent axial methine protons in the CHDA residues, in order tominimize steric hindrance. Our fundamental understanding of pre-cisely controlling the thermodynamic stability of a target product byusing directing group to regulate the intramolecular forces, is thussigni?cantly improved. Such results help us to rule out the reliance ofcationic transition metal templates that might be highly toxic. Futureresearch includes self-assembly of cage molecules with larger cavitiesand water-solubility, so that these self-assembled hosts are employedfor applications in some more challenging arenas, such as mimickingenzyme79每82in arti ?cial systems.",topology

"Cite This: ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2021, 13, 24042 ?24050 Read OnlineACCESS Metrics & More Article Recommendations *s?Supporting InformationABSTRACT: Porous organic molecular (POM) materials can exhibit solvatomorphs viaaltering their crystallographic packing in the solid state, but investigating real gas mixtureseparation by porous materials with such a behavior is still very rare. Herein, we report thata lantern-shaped calix[4]resorcinarene-based porous organic cage (POC, namely, CPOC-101) can exhibit eight distinct solid-state solvatomorphs via crystallization in di ?erentsolvents. This POC solvatomorphism has a signi ?cant in ?uence on their gas sorptioncapacities as well as separation abilities. Speci ?cally, the apparent Brunauer ?Emmett ?Teller (BET) surface area determined by nitrogen gas sorption at 77 K for CPOC-101 汐crystallized from toluene/chloroform is up to 406 m2g?1, which is much higher than therest of CPOC-101 solvatomorphs with BET values less than 40 m2g?1. More interestingly, C2H2and CO2adsorbed capacities, inaddition to the C2H2/CO2separation ability at room temperature for CPOC-101 汐, are superior to those of CPOC-101 汕crystalizedfrom nitrobenzene, the representative of POC solvatomorphs with low BET surface areas. These results indicate the possibility ofadjusting gas sorption and separation properties of POC materials by controlling their solvatomorphs.",surface area
"Nitrogen Gas Sorption Isotherms. For activated CPOC-101, the permanent porosity was evaluated using N 2gassorption experiments at 77 K. As shown in Figure 3 ,N2uptakeofCPOC-101 汐exhibits a high value as of 130 cm3g?1at 1atm, and its adsorption behavior typically exhibits a type Icurve with a small fraction of type IV adsorption isotherm. Inaddition, CPOC-101 汐exhibits a Brunauer ?Emmett ?Teller(BET) surface area of up to 406 m2g?1(Figure S14 ) and amicropore volume of 0.14 cm3g?1. Its NLDFT pore sizeranges from 0.5 to 0.6 nm, which is close to the channeldiameter of CPOC-101 汐in the crystal structure ( Figure S15 ).",surface area
"A similar situation also appeared in CPOC-101 汕. For CPOC-101汕,C O 2breakthrough occurs in 16.4 min, and C 2H2breakthrough did not occur until 25.7 min ( Figure 6 c). Thelonger e ?ective separation time of CPOC-101 汐than CPOC-101汕suggested that the C 2H2/CO 2separation ability ofCPOC-101 汐is better than that of CPOC-101 汕, consistentwith the trend of the IAST results. According to thebreakthrough experiments, the calculated separation factorsof C2H2/CO 2forCPOC-101 汐andCPOC-101 汕are 2.2 and2.0, respectively. Furthermore, con ?rming CPOC-101 汐stability can be realized by conducting recycling experiments.AsFigure 6 d displays, the breakthrough time remainsunchanged after four recycling experiments. The long break-through time interval between CO2and C 2H2, as well as thegood recycling performance, further indicates that CPOC-101汐is an auspicious system toward C 2H2/CO 2separation.←CONCLUSIONSIn summary, eight distinct [2 + 4] dimeric calix[4]-resorcinarene-based porous organic cage ( CPOC-101 ) sol-vatomorphs have been prepared by recrystallization fromdi?erent aromatic and/or CHCl3solvents. To the best of ourknowledge, CPOC-101 not only presents the ?rst example ofthe solvatomorphic phenomenon in the cavitand-based POCsystem but also o ?ers the richest solvatomorphism in the POCsystem. More interestingly, the solvatomorphism is related togas sorption and separation abilities of POCs. Speci ?cally,C2H2and CO 2adsorbed capacities, as well as the C 2H2/CO 2separation ability of CPOC-101 (in this case, CPOC-101 汐)with a higher BET surface (406 m2g?1), are much better thanthe solvatomorphs with a low BET surface ( CPOC-101 汕,3 8m2g?1). Moreover, CPOC-101 also represents the ?rstmaterial to realize the C 2H2/CO 2gas mixture separation inthe POC ?eld. Such an outcome may shed light on controllingsolvatomorphs of POM materials to judicially tailor their gassorption as well as separation abilities.",surface area

"55However, the solvatomorphic phenomenon in such cavitand-based cages has not been observed.56Moreover, the in ?uenceof POC solvatomorphs on their gas separation performanceshas not been explored so far. In this work, we have found thatthe dimeric [2 + 4] calix[4]resorcinarene-based POC canexhibit many solvatomorphs via crystallization in di ?erentsolvents, including toluene (PhMe), nitrobenzene (PhNO2),ethylbenzene (PhEt), styrene (PhCH 洎CH 2), xylenes(PhMe 2), and dichlorobenzenes (PhCl 2). Interestingly, wehave also found that the POC solvatomorphism of this cagehas a great in ?uence on N2, acetylene (C 2H2), and carbondioxide (CO 2) gas sorption capacities, as well as on the C 2H2/CO 2separation ability.",topology

9. Molecular Simulations  CC18  was studied in its [4+6] and [8+12] molecular masses . Each structure was initially evaluated with high temperature molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in order to explore the potential energy surfaces (PESs) and to identify the lowest ener gy conformers.,topology
"MD simulations were performed with the Macromodel Software (Schr ?dinger PLC) and the recently released OPLS3 force field .[6] The calculations were run at 1000 K for 100 ns with a time step of 1 fs, and each involved the sampling of 10 ,000 structures that were minimi zed at each step of the simulation. The lowest energy conformer was collapsed in both cases (see Figure S24 每 a1 for [4+6] and b1 for [8+12]). H owever , higher energy open conformers were also identified (see Figure S24 每 a2 for [4+6]  and b2 for [8+12]).",topology

"Both open and collapsed conformers for  the [4+6] and [8+12] molecules were re -optimi zed with Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods  in order to rank the structures according to their energy with more accuracy,  and therefore predict the most likely reaction outcome.",topology
"The relative energies  of the conformers were compared, assuming that the conformer with the lowest relative energy is the more likely to form. All of the energies are calculated per [4+6] unit and relative to the energy of the collapsed conformer of [4+6]. Figure S25 shows that the [8+12] size is favoured compared to the [4+6], with the open conformer of [8+12] being 10 kJ mol-1 lower in energy than the collapsed structure of [4+6], therefore explaining the experimental form ation of the [8+12] cage. Furthermore, and in accordance with the experimental results, CC18  is likely to collapse, with the collapsed conformer being  65 kJ mol-1 lower in energy than the equivalent open conformer.",topology

"IntroductionShape-persistent organic cages arefascinating synthetic targets,because their size, geometry, andthepresence offunctionalgroups intheexterior aswellastheinterior oftheir cavities canbeprecisely controlled.[1每10]Inaddition totheshape-persistencyandthus thepresence ofanintrinsic pore orcavity, thesemolecular compounds canbeseen asprocessable porous units,ifsoluble enough. This unique combination ofporous cageproperties hasbeen used todecorate surfaces ofquartz crystalmicrobalances,[11,12]making cage-containing membranes,[13,14]coating columns with cages for gas chromatographicpurposes,[15,16]using cage-films forsensing applications,[17]orgenerating porous liquids.[18,19]Nowadays, shape-persistent organic cages aremainlysynthesized byusing reversible condensation reactions, such asbymultiple imine bond formation orthegeneration ofboronicesters from thecorresponding diols andboronic acids.[20每60]These reactions used areoften called dynamic covalentchemistry (DCC) reactions, allowing thesystem toreachthermodynamic equilibrium byself-correction mechanisms duetotheintrinsic reversibility.[5,61,62]However, notalways istheformed cage also thefavored product ofthermodynamicequilibrium andtheequilibrium needs tobeshifted byeitherremoving product byprecipitation or,incaseofformed water,byDean-Stark traps orother scavengers (e.g.molecularsieves).[39,42,57,63]Especially when theformed cage isprecipitatingoutofthereaction mixture, itisnotalways clear, ifthecage isathermodynamically orkinetically controlled product.[64,65]Infact,foralarge number ofexperimental protocols, pure cage isgenerated byprecipitation, andithastobequestioned, ifinthese cases thecages arekinetically rather than thermodynami-cally controlled products, especially ifcalculated heat offormations donotfittheexperimental observations.[42,45,46,66]During ourresearch onshape-persistent imine cages,[8]there were afewexamples, where thecages were completelyinsoluble inallcommon solvents, restricting theanalysis toFT-IRspectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis andpore analysis bygassorption.[41,67,68]These were thecubic [414]cage1,which hadhigh specific surface areaof1014 m2/g,highCO2uptake (18.2 wt%) andaverygood Henry selectivity orCO2vsCH4adsorption of40;[41]the[416]exo-functionalized cage2,with similar specific surface area (1037 m2/g)andCO2uptake(14.8 wt%);[67]andthe[416]endo-functionalized cage3,withnoalkyl substituent para tothephenolic OHoftheusedsalicyldialdehyde (Figure 1).[38,68]Although bymonitoring thecage formation bytime-dependent mass spectrometry, polymer oroligomer formationassidereactions were excluded, suggesting thattheproductsarepure cages andthus kinetically controlled products, finalproof ofstructure byNMR spectroscopy oreven single crystalX-ray diffraction waslacking.",surface area

However, mostofthesynthesized imine cages reported areformed asprecipitate from thereaction mixture andtherefore rathermay bekinetically controlled products. There areevenexamples inliterature, where resulting cages arenotsolubleatallincommon organic solvents tocharacterize orstudytheir formation byNMR spectroscopy insolution. Here, atriptycene triamine containing three solubilizing n-hexyloxychains hasbeen used tosynthesize soluble congeners ofpriorinsoluble cages. Thisallowed ustostudy theformation aswell asthereversibility ofcage formation insolution byinvestigating exchange ofbuilding blocks between thecagesanddeuterated derivatives thereof.",this paper's author

Uncertainties were calculated applying  propagation of uncertainty  by using the error of weighing.  Since the amount of standard has been calculated by its mas s and the 100% yield amount of cage has been calculated by the amount of added 3,6,15 -triamino -1,8,13 -trihexyloxytriptycene divided by 4 the variables nstandard  and ntheor . can be exchanged using  n = m M-1:  ??=??1?????????????????? 4??????????????0?????????????????? ?????????????100% =400% ???1??????????????0????????????????????????????????????????????????.

The error of the yi eld 忖灰 can be calculated using propagation of uncertainty :  ????=???????????????????????????????????????????? +???????????????????????????????? .

As shown in Figure 1,  1-aldehyde -4-hydroxy -calix[4]arene (CHO -C4A), a conical calix[4]arene with four aldehyde groups on the upper -rim, and tris(4 -aminophenyl)amine (TAPA) or 1,3,5 -tris(4 -aminophenyl)benzene (TAPB), a rigid triangular triamine, were self-assembled though the Sc hiff base reaction to form stoichiometric [6+8] type organic cages (named C4A -TAPA and C4A-TAPB, collectively called C4A-POC s).",topology
"The configuration of the individual cage was predicted, based on the geometry and binding mode of the pre -designed building blocks. Generally, when conical C4A assembles with linear units, the resulting products exhibit diverse configurations including edge-directed cages such as [2+4] dimers, [3+6] triangular prisms, and [6+12] truncated octahedrons (Fig ure S1).[4e] Alternatively, they may form spatially extended two -dimensional layered structures.[12] However, if C4A assembles with planar triangular units , like TAPA or TAPB, it is highly probable that the truncated octahedral organic cages with a stoichiometry of [6+8] will be formed (Fig ure 1).",topology
"However, the acquisition of a single crystal sample presents a formidable challenge due to the substantial molecular weight of this molecular cage, which hinders the determination of accurate  crystal structure data.  At present, only two SC -XRD data of the similar large -sized POC s are reported by Yuan Daqiang＆s group[11c]. Nevertheless, matrix -assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight  (MALDI -TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry can determine the relative molecular mass of the reaction product, which is usually employed  to verify the existence of the discrete cages.[14] The MALDI -TOF-MS spectra of C4A -POC s (Fig ure 2e) were collected by dissolving them in DMSO. The major ion signals of C4A -TAPA and C4A -TAPB are m/z 5109.0 and m/z 5594.2, which correspond to the theoretical relative molecular weight of [6+8] cage s (calc. C 336H240O24N32: m/z 5109.7 for C4A -TAPA and calc. C 384H264O24N24: m/z 5598.4 for C4A -TAPB). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig ure 2f) show that C4A -POC s are spherical particles , and C4A -TAPB is a uniform nanoparticle with a diameter of less than 100 nm.  The thermogravimetric  analysis (TGA) in Fig ure S2 shows that C4A -POC s do not substantially lose weight until the temperature rises to 400 ?C, demonstrating their high thermal stability.",topology
"Conclusion  In summary , we propose that when the four-jaw conical C4A units meet  the triangular structural blocks, they tend to t ake place  the face-directed self -assembly process , resulting in the formation of  octahedral  cages with the stoichiometry of [6+8] . This statement  indicates the highly structural predictability of C4A -POCs and supports  the design strategy for organic cages based on C4A -CHO and p lanar triamine s. We have successfully implemented this idea and synthesized two large -sized POCs , namely C4A -TAPA ( C336H240O24N32) and C4A -TAPB ( C384H264O24N24). The PXRD analysis reveal s the crystalline  characteristics  of the two C4A-POCs ; however , precise crystallographic data are unavailable due to the absence of a single crystal sample . The formation of the large cages is confirmed through their relative molecular mass measured using MALDI -TOF/TOF spectra.",topology

"[20藩23]This elegant work has led tonanocontainers,[20,21]rhombicuboctahedral nanocapsules,[22]and a chiral nanocube[23]using structurally defined, ↗pro-hollow∫ cavitands as building blocks. These organic moleculescan reach impressive sizes: for example, the [6 +8] giantrhombicuboctahedron[22]was estimated to have a solvody-namic diameter of 3.9 nm, and molecular models suggested acavity volume of around 4700 /C1383. Unfortunately, crystalssuitable for X-ray diffraction could not be obtained andstructures were therefore inferred from a combination ofNMR spectroscopy and molecular mechanics calcula-tions.",topology
"As shown in Figure 3b, there is no longer an interconnectedFigure 1. Single-crystal X-ray structures of CC7 and the [4 +6] tetra-hedral cage CC5[25](1 nm scale bar). The yellow octahedron andtetrahedron are included to visualize the shape of the cavity.",topology
"By contrast, MD simulations for solvent-free crystalstructures of the porous cages that we reported previously(CC2,[6]CC3,[6]andCC5[25]) showed that both the cage shapeand the interconnected porous channels were maintainedduring 5 ns NPT simulations (see the Supporting Informa-tion). This suggests that the force field is reliable and providesinteresting clues as to why some organic cages are shape-persistent and stable to desolvation, and others are not. Thesmaller [4+6] cages CC2 and CC3 lack the additionalflexibility provided by the tris(4-formylphenyl)amine unitsthat allow for bond rotation in the plane of the face. It istherefore highly unfavorable for a vertex to fold into the cagecavity. By contrast, in the larger [4+6] cage, CC5,[25]the sameflexible torsions observed in CC7 are present, and CC5 isindeed observed to be significantly more flexible in MDsimulations. However, the [4 +6] stoichiometry in CC5 resultsin a different topology and a much smaller cage voidcompared to the [8+12] cage, CC7. Although the cavity sizeinCC5 is sufficiently large to allow a vertex to fold inwards,there is no structural possibility of gaining intramolecular p-pstacking interactions between the arene faces (Figure S9).",topology
"[35]In essence, the single-crystal structures for CC7 andCC8represent cages in a ↗sea∫ of solvent molecules. Hence, onemight expect similar structures to persist in true molecularsolutions. The1H NMR spectra of CC7 recorded at 20 8C andat 508C showed two distinct imine proton signals ( d=8.25and 8.35 ppm), instead of the single imine environmentobserved for the smaller [4+6] cages (Figure S24).[6,13]Thereare also two imine carbon resonances ( d=159.2 and159.3 ppm) in the13C NMR spectrum. This confirms thepresence of two distinct imine environments in the solutionstructure of the CC7 molecule that do not exchange on theNMR timescale, consistent with the crystal structure wherehalf of the imine protons point outwards (Figure S25) and theother half towards the interior of the cage ( 3ㄙin Figure S25).",topology
"The formation of CC7 also demonstrates the strongsensitivity of dynamic covalent assembly reactions to smallchanges in the substrates. For example, a [4+6] cage ( CC5;Figure 1)[25]forms rather than the [8 +12]CC7 species when(R,R)-1,2-cyclopentanediamine is used in place of the cyclo-hexane analogue under otherwise similar reaction conditions.",topology
"The equivalent collapse mechanism is not possible for CC2 and CC3 as there is little freedom for rotation about the plane of the arene face compared to the t ri(4-formylphenyl) containing cages, as shown in Figure S25. This is further confirmed from the simulations where these Carene-Carene-Namine-Carene torsions in the face of CC7 are frozen, significantly stabilising the structure with respect to a total collapse and loss of porosity upon amorphization. However, there is a secondary problem in that there is a large energetic benefit towards CC7 collapsing with one vertex  folding in open itself, not only in increasing the attractive dispersive interactions between different parts of the cage molecules, but, perhaps more importantly, in facilitating the formation of 迼 藩 迼 stacking interactions from arene species on opposite  faces. Whilst this energetic benefit should in theory be possible for the tri(4 -formylphenyl) species in the smaller [4+6] CC5 molecule, the smaller size of CC5 compared to the [8+12] CC7 molecule means that whilst there may be space for a vertex to fold in this would not result in the formation of 迼 藩 迼 stacking interactions between arene species as they cannot align to each other (refer back to Figure S11 to compare the size of the speci es). Finally the CC7 structure does not collapse when solvated with DCM, it is suggested that this is a result of the DCM acting as a space filler or ↗scaffold∫, preventing the cage vertices folding inwards , rather than any special interaction between DCM and cage molecules.",topology
"As part of the future design process for hypothetical shape persistent cage molecules, computational screening of the stability of the cage to collapse can be envisaged. If a possible cage molecule is designed then a computer model can be built and MD simulations run to exmaine if the cage is shape persistent. There are several points that make this approach challenging; firstly the stoichiometry of the cages (for example [4+6] versus  [8+12] and so on) is not currently possible to predict ab initio  and secondly new cage chemistry may not be adequately described by available FF parameters and these large molecules are typically outside the reach of ab initio  molecular dynamics calculations due to the large computational expense.",topology
"[24]The cageswere obtained through [8 +12] imine condensation reactionsbetween two relatively simple precursors, tris(4-formylphe-nyl)amine (Scheme 1, A) and the chiral diamines ( R,R)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine ( B1) and ( R,R)-1,2-cyclohex-4-enedia-mine ( B2) to yield CC7 and CC8, respectively. The reactionoccurs without any additional template or catalyst (Scheme 1)to generate the A8B12cage in good yield (85每90%) throughformation of 24 new imine bonds.",topology
"In fact, disordered dichloromethane is the major consti-tuent of the crystalline phase and it occupies more than 70%of the available solvent-accessible volume〞in total, about75000 /C1383per unit cell. This amounts to around 80 and 75dichloromethane molecules per cage molecule for CC7 andCC8, respectively, although we cannot exclude the possibilitythat some of the protective medium, mesitylene, also diffusesScheme 1. One-pot [8 +12] synthesis of cages CC7 and CC8.",topology
"Both cages have tetrahedral Tsymmetry, and by defining thecentral amine nitrogen atoms in the 8 Aunits (Scheme 1) asnodes, its topology is equivalent to that of the [8 +12] chiralnanocube structure proposed by Warmuth.[23]The 8 triphenyl-amine moieties occupy the vertices and the 12 diamine linkersoccupy the edges of this highly distorted cube (Figure S4). Bycontrast, the molecular shape, as opposed to the topology, hasmore similarities with the structural model proposed for arhombicuboctahedral capsule.",topology

"[14a,b,15]For thesereasons, dynamic covalent chemistry has received tremen-dous attention in the development of novel responsive mate-rials,[14d,16]delivery devices,[17]and molecular libraries fordrug discovery,[18]as well as in the target-oriented synthesisof topologically complex molecules,[15,19]such as knots,[20]catenanes,[19b,21]rotaxanes,[22]or polycyclic receptors.[16i,23]Recently, we developed a rational design concept for theassembly of polycavitand nanocapsules using imine chemis-try (Scheme 1).[24每26]For example, condensation of tetra-formyl cavitand 1with two equivalents of a kinked, 120 8di-amine unit ( 5a,b) or a rigid, linear, 180 8diamine unit ( 6a)yields octaimine hemicarcerands ( 2a,b) or a hexadecaiminetetrahedral nanocapsule ( 3a) in close to quantitativeyield.[24b,d,e,27]On the other hand, a cavitand-hexamer ( 4a)forms upon reaction of six cavitands 1with eight planar,trigonal triamines ( 7a).[24a]The outcome of these assemblyprocesses relies on the rigidity of the building blocks, theirgeometric features, and the imine bonds as linear connec-tors, whereby the preferred condensation products becomestrongly favored over other possible polycyclic or acyclicoligomers. In other words, each nanocapsule is prepro-grammed into the specific combination of reactants. A dis-advantage of imine bonds is their relatively small stabilityAbstract: The thermodynamically con-trolled syntheses of different di-, tetra-,and hexacavitand polyacylhydrazonenanocapsules are reported. [2+4]-,[4+8]-, and [6 +12]-nanocapsules as-semble upon reacting a tetraformylcavitand with two equivalents of iso-phthalic dihydrazide, or terephthalic di-hydrazide in the presence of trifluoro-acetic acid, whereby the buildingblocks are linked together through 8,16, or 24 newly formed acylhydrazonebonds. Futhermore, the reaction of thetetraformylcavitands with differenttrigonal planar trihydrazides, simulta-neously leads to the formation of [2+4]- and [6 +8]-nanocapsules in varyingratios that depend on the cavitand totrihydrazide ratio and the nature of thecavitand and trihydrazide buildingblocks. The product ratios are rational-ized with the different conformationalstrain of the acylhydrazone linkages inthese nanocapsules. Diffusion NMR ex-periments with the hexacavitand polya-cylhydrazone nanocapsules yield solvo-dynamic radii that range from 1.6 to2.5 nm, consistent with estimates fromforce field calculations, and support,that these capsules have solvent filled,spherical interiors, the sizes of whichapproaches those of smaller proteins.",topology

"In contrast to 3b, for which evidence of formation of a re-lated octahedral hexacavitand capsule could not be obtainedin the1H NMR spectrum and MALDI TOF of the reactionmixture, 10band19must have comparable thermodynamicstabilities in solution. In earlier studies, we observed a simi-lar octahedral [6 +12]-capsule 24in the condensation of 1with two equivalents of ethylene-1,2-diamine in CHCl3,which formed in 82% yield, together with small amounts(/C255%) of the tetrahedral [4 +8]-capsule 3c(Schemes 1 and3). In THF, only 3cwas observed (35% yield). Our ration-ale for the formation of these nanocapsules, rather than thecorresponding hemicarcerand 2d([2+4]-condensation cap-sule), was: 1) the lower conformational energy of the 1,2-di-azaethylene units in the larger capsules, in which they canadapt the anti conformation, as opposed to 2d, which re-quires gauche conformations, and 2) the different ability ofthe solvent (CHCl3versus THF) to solvate the lowestenergy linker conformations in 20and 3c. Increasing thepreference for the anticonformation as in ethylene-1,2-bi-s(4＊anilide) (H2N-C6H4-CH2CH2C6H4-NH2) or using a rigid,linear diamine, such as 6bor benzidine, gave quantitativelya tetrahedral [4 +8]-condensation capsule. Thus, cavitand 1inherently prefers to form tetrahedral nanocapsules withlinear diamine components. This preference is confirmedwith the exclusive formation of 3band has also been ob-served in cavitand-based metal-coordination capsules.",topology
"[11a]Itcan be rationalized with the geometry of the cavitand build-ing block, in which adjacent and opposing aryl每carbonylbonds form angles of 44 and 63.88, which are too small for astrain-free octahedron (60 and 90 8) with a rigid diaminolinker and better suited for a smaller capsule.[42]However,the formation of 19in the condensation of 8with 6b, sug-gests that with increasing flexibility the inherent preferencefor the [4 +8]-capsule vanishes and that larger [6 +12]-con-densation capsules become accessible.",topology
"Reaction of cavitands 1 and 8 trihydrazides 7b每e : We alsoinvestigated the possibility to assemble hexacavitand nano-capsules 4and11through the acid-catalyzed reaction of sixequivalents of 1or8with eight equivalents of C3-symmetrictrihydrazides ( 7b每e; Scheme 1).

"Hemicarcerand formation may compete with hexacavi-tand nanocapsule formation since the angle between two re-acting hydrazide groups in 7a每eis appropriate for a [2+4]-condensation. The propensity of the different trihydrazidesto yield hexacavitand capsules and/or hemicarcerands canbe rationalized with the linker strain in these capsules andwith the tendency to maximize the number of intramolecu-lar hydrazone linkages. We estimated the strain associatedwith improper acylhydrazone conformations in the hexacavi-tand nanocapsules and hemicarcerands from energy-mini-mized structures (AMBER*, CHCl3) by comparing the con-formational energy of each linker with that of its lowestenergy conformation. Results are summarized in Table 1.",topology
"Based on these strain estimates, formation of a hexacavi-tand capsule is favored for the reaction of 1with trihydra-zide 7b. Inserting a phenyl unit into the cavitand/C29s aryl /C0CHO bond increases linker strain in the [6 +8]-condensationcapsule and reduces strain in the [2 +4]-condensation capsu-le beyond that of the former capsule, such that 20becomesthe only identifiable product in the reaction of 8with 7b.",topology
"For the same reason, reaction of 8with 7d, which is an ex-tended version of 7b, does not yield the [6 +8]-condensationcapsule 11d.

This suggests, that the [6+8]-condensation capsules areless flexible as compared to the [6 +12]-capsule, which, dueto its mode of construction, should be easier deformed andcompressed. Therefore, the former design should be superbfor capsule assembly in aqueous solution and may providelarge hydrophobic cavities in water.",topology

By means of a fragment couplingapproach, molecular triangular prisms of electron-rich andelectron-de ?cient aromatic interiors were prepared using1,3,5-tri( p-hydroxyphenyl)benzene and 2,4,6-tri( p-aminophe-nyl)triazine as base units and chlorotriazines as pillars. Aro-matic nucleophilic substitution reaction of chlorotriazinemoieties with functionalized amines led to triangular prismswith functionalizations on the peripheral edge positions, whilefunctionalized triangular prisms on the vertex nitrogen posi-tions were obtained using 2,4,6-tri[( p-allylamino)phenyl]-triazine derivative as a starting material. Symmetrical anddistorted molecular triangular prisms in the solid state were revealed by X-ray crystallography. As evidenced by NMR spectroscopicdata, however, all cage molecules synthesized most probably adopted highly symmetric triangular prism structures in solution phase.The functionalized shape-persistent triangular prism structures might ?nd applications in molecular recognition and in theconstruction of higher and more sophisticated molecular architectures in supramolecular chemistry.",this paper's author

 ?Note on Nomenclature: Helicity, or axial chirality, is an intrinsic property of these molecular cages. All six bisimino vertices must be of the same enantiomer, and the vertex substituents must occupy exo-positions, in order to obtain a tetrahedral molecular structure. In this study, CC3 was prepared using the homochiral (1R,2R)-cyclohexanediamine to give the homochiral cage, CC3-R. All reactions reported proceed identically with the opposite enantiomer, CC3-S. Where the cage is referred to as CC3, for brevity, this refers to the homochiral cage, CC3-R, rather than the racemate (CC3-R,S). Reducing CC3 to RCC3 and the further modification to AT-RCC3 and FT-RCC3 does not change the chirality of the cage.   1. Experimental Details  1.1. Materials. 1,3,5-Triformylbenzene was purchased from Manchester Organics, UK. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. CC3 (Cage 3) was prepared as previously reported in its homochiral form, CC3-R.1  1.2 Synthesis of RCC3. The imine cage CC3-R (926 mg, 0.83 mmol) was dissolved in a CHCl3 / methanol mixture (1:1 v/v, 50 mL) by stirring. When this solution became clear, sodium borohydride (1.00 g, 26.5 mol) was added and the reaction was stirred for a further 12 hours at room temperature. Water (2 mL) was then added, and the reaction stirred for a further 12 hours. The solvent was then removed under vacuum. The resulting white solid was extracted with chloroform (2 ℅ 50 mL) and then the combined organic phase was washed by water (2 ℅ 100 mL). The CHCl3 phase was dried using anhydrous MgSO4 before being removed under vacuum. Amine cage 1 (crude yield = 900 mg, 95.1 %) was obtained as a white solid. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz) 汛 7.12 (s, 12H, -ArH), 3.81 (d, 12H, -ArCH2), 3.59 (d, 12H, -ArCH2), 2.18 (m, 12H, CH on cyclohexane), 0.95 - 1.98 (m, 48H, CH2 on cyclohexane) ppm; 13C NMR  (CDCl3, 100 MHz): 汛 141.2, 124.9, 61.2, 50.7, 32.0, 25.0 ppm.

Synthesis of AT-RCC3. The reduced amine cage RCC3 (50 mg, 0.044 mmol) was dissolved in 3 mL acetone in a 10 mL vial. The vial was sealed and left to stand. Single crystals of AT-RCC3 gradually appeared on the walls and the bottom of the vial after about 30 min. The crystals were collected after 12 h by filtration and washed by acetone (2 ℅ 100 mL).

 ?1.4. Synthesis of FT-RCC3. Paraformaldehyde (52 mg, 20 eq.) dissolved in CH3OH (10 mL) was stirred at 70 ∼C. To this clear solution was added RCC3 (100 mg) dissolved in CH3OH (10 mL). A white precipitate appeared upon addition of RCC3. The reaction was stirred for a further 2 h at 70 ∼C. The reaction was cooled to room temperature and the precipitate was collected by filtration. FT-RCC3 (52 mg, 70 %) was obtained after being washed with CH3OH (3 ℅ 10 mL) and dried under vacuum. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz) 汛 7.11 (s, 12H, -ArH), 3.99 (d, 12H, -ArCH2 ), 3.23 (s, 12 H, -NCH2N-), 3.19 (d, 12H, -ArCH2 ), 2.27 (d, 12H, CH on cyclohexane), 1.96 (d, 12H, CH2 on cyclohexane ), 1.80 (d, 12H, CH2 on cyclohexane ), 1.28 (m, 24H, CH2 on cyclohexane) ppm; 13C NMR  (CDCl3, 100 MHz): 汛 140.1, 123.6, 77.2, 68.8, 57.3, 29.4, 24.4 ppm.

Solution 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 400.13 MHz using a Bruker Avance 400 NMR spectrometer. 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 100.6 MHz.   1.5.2 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). IR spectra were collected on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer. Samples were analyzed as KBr disks for 16 scans with a resolution of 4 cm-1. Spectra were recorded in transmission mode.  1.5.3 Thermogravimetric Analysis. TGA analysis was carried out using a Q5000IR analyzer (TA instruments) with an automated vertical overhead thermobalance. The samples were heated at the rate of 5 ∼C /min.   1.5.4 Powder X-ray Diffraction. Laboratory powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were collected in transmission mode on samples held on thin Mylar film in aluminum well plates on a Panalytical X＊Pert PRO MPD equipped with a high throughput screening (HTS) XYZ stage, X-ray focusing mirror, and PIXcel detector, using Ni-filtered Cu K汐 radiation. Data were measured over the range 5?50∼ in ‵0.013∼ steps over 60 min.  1.5.5 Electron Microscopy. Imaging of the crystal morphology was achieved using a Hitachi S-4800 cold field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) operating in both scanning and transmission modes. Scanning-mode samples were prepared by depositing dry crystals on 15 mm Hitachi M4 aluminum stubs using an adhesive high-purity carbon tab before coating with a 2 nm layer of gold using an Emitech K550X automated sputter coater. Imaging was conducted at a working distance of 8 mm and a working voltage of 3 kV using a mix of upper and lower secondary electron detectors. Transmission-mode samples were prepared by dispersing the cage particles in a methanol suspension and depositing onto carbon-coated copper grids (300 mesh), imaging at 30 kV working voltage and 7 mm distance.

 ?1.5.6 Gas Sorption Analysis. Gases of the following purities were used: hydrogen (99.9995% - BOC gases) and carbon dioxide (SCF grade 每 BOC gases). Surface areas and pore size distributions were measured by nitrogen adsorption and desorption at 77.3 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 volumetric adsorption analyzer. Samples were degassed at offline at 80 ∼C for 15 h under vacuum (10-5 bar) before analysis, followed by degassing on the analysis port under vacuum, also at 80 ∼C. Carbon dioxide isotherms were measured at 289K using a Micromeritics 2420 volumetric adsorption analyzer using the same degassing procedure.  1.5.7 Single Crystal X-ray Diffraction.  Single crystal X-ray data were measured on a Rigaku MicroMax-007 HF rotating anode diffractometer (Mo-K汐 radiation, 竹 = 0.71073 ?, Kappa 4-circle goniometer, Rigaku Saturn724+ detector). Or for formaldehyde tied reduced CC3 (FT-RCC3) at beamline I19, Diamond Light Source, Didcot, UK using silicon double crystal monochromated radiation (竹 = 0.6889 ?).2 Empirical absorption corrections using equivalent reflections were performed with the program SADABS.3 Structure were solved with SHELXD,4 or by direct methods using SHELXS,4 and reined by full-matrix least squares on F2 by SHELXL-97,4 interfaced through the programme OLEX2.5 Unless stated all non-H atoms were refined anisotropically and H atoms were fixed in geometrically estimated positions using the riding model. In the absence of heavy scatters Friedel pairs were merged.  1.6 Desolvation of RCC3. To obtain a large quantity of crystalline RCC3 for subsequent analysis, a solution of RCC3 dissolved in CHCl3 was allowed to slowly evaporate over two days. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) confirmed that this solvate material was the same phase as the single-crystal structure (Figure S1). Different desolvation methods for activation of the RCC3 solvate were investigated, including high/low temperature vacuum, N2 flow, solvent exchange, and supercritical CO2 drying. However, none of these activation conditions maintained the crystallinity of RCC3 upon desolvation, and we instead isolated an amorphous solid in all cases that showed no Bragg reflections in the PXRD pattern (Figure S1).",comprehensive synthesis
"Schi?-base chemistry is one of the most versatile methods forthe construction of organic macrocycles and cages.1Thereversibility of the imine bond-forming reaction gives a route tothermodynamically equilibrated products. This has been used toproduce crystalline porous organic solids, such as covalentorganic frameworks (COFs)2and porous molecular organiccages.3In particular, a series of porous, shape-persistent iminecages has been reported,4and surface areas as high as 3758 m2/ghave been attained,5thus rivaling extended frameworks such asmetal?organic frameworks (MOFs).6Porous molecular organicsolids show promise as adsorbents for radioisotope pollutants,7as molecular additives in organic ?organic mixed-matrixmembranes,8as shape-selective chromatography phases,9andas materials for molecular sensing.10However, the reversibility of imine chemistry, which permitsequilibrium products to form, can also cause problems ofchemical instability, thus limiting its wider application. Imines areprone to hydrolysis and can decompose upon exposure toatmospheric moisture, although there are some exceptions tothis.2,11Imines are even more prone to hydrolysis in acidic orbasic environments. A straightforward way to make an iminemore chemically stable is to reduce it to the correspondingamine. In addition to enhancing chemical stability, amine cagesare also readily functionalized12and can provide binding sites forguests such as CO 2.13However, while many amine cages andmacrocycles have been reported via imine reduction, no trulyshape-persistent porous amine cages have been discovered. Thisis because reduction to the amine introduces additional ?exibilityin the cage molecule, and this leads to loss of the internal cavity,or pore. We previously reported a [4+6] amine cage formed byreduction of the equivalent imine cage, CC1, but crystallizationattempts yielded only amorphous, nonporous solids for theamine derivative.",surface area

"Like CC3, desolvated AT-RCC3 packs in a window-to-window fashion (Figure 2a). Gas adsorption analysis fordesolvated AT-RCC3 (Figure 3a) showed that the materialadsorbs a very modest amount of N2(1.11 mmol/g) and H 2(1.29 mmol/g) at 77 K and 1 bar. The apparent BET surface areawas just 67 m2/g, as calculated from the N 2isotherm. This surfacearea and gas uptake are substantially lower than for isostructuralCC3.3aHowever, close to ambient temperature, a CO 2uptake of1.77 mmol/g was observed for AT-RCC3 牯that is, 8 timeshigher than for RCC3 (Figure 3b). The ideal gas selectivity forCO 2/N2was calculated as 57 at 298 K and 1 bar. This is close tothe CO 2/N2selectivity of the [2+3] imine cages reported byZhang et al.,15but with a much higher absolute CO 2uptake (1.77mmol/g for AT-RCC3 vs 0.1?0.25 mmol/g for the Zhangcages). The lack of N2and H2adsorption at low temperature inAT-RCC3 is explained by its crystal structure. The solvent-accessible surface with a N2probe radius of 1.82 ?21showsformally disconnected voids (Figure 2b). This is because thedimethyl groups block two of the four windows on each AT-RCC3 cage. The interconnectivity of the pore structure for N2thus depends upon the spatial arrangement of these dimethyl-blocked windows with respect to one another.",surface area
"The FT-RCC3 material can be fully desolvated under dynamicvacuum for 12 h at 80 ∼C. Unlike AT-RCC3 , there was noindication of any loss of crystallinity for FT-RCC3 after eitherdesolvation or after gas adsorption, a promising indicator ofincreased shape persistence (Figures S10 and S11). The porousnature of FT-RCC3 was next probed by N2,H2, and CO2adsorption. Nitrogen adsorption measurements at 77 K showed aType I isotherm (Figure 3a), with a total gas uptake of 11.2mmol/g at 1.0 bar and an apparent BET surface area of 377 m2/g.",surface area
"This is only slightly lower than the 409 m2/g measured for theparent imine cage, CC3.17However, both materials haveprecisely the same ※molar §BET surface area of 457 m2/mmolwhen their molecular weights are considered. FT-RCC3 adsorbs4.3 mmol/g of H 2at 77 K and 1.0 bar, and 1.42 mmol/g of CO 2at298 K and 1 bar. As can seen from the calculated solvent-accessible surface (Figure 3c), the pores in FT-RCC3 areinterconnected for a 1.42 ? H2probe. This interconnectivitypersists for a smaller 1.55 ? probe (equivalent to a N 2moleculeoriented end-on) but becomes formally disconnected for a N 2van der Waals radius probe of 1.82 ?. We assume that breathingmotions of the molecule allow for di ?usion of N 2through thepore structure, as observed for CC3.23A conformational search for FT-RCC3 found that the lowestenergy conformer was the observed shape-persistent structure,comprising a permanent void (Figure 2d). A partially foldedconformation (Figure S12) was also found to lie 22 kJ/molhigher in energy, as calculated with the OPLS-AA force ?eld.24DFT calculations (see SI for full details) con ?rmed that the openstructure was indeed the lowest energy molecular structure, withan energy gap of 14 kJ/mol. An overlay of the calculatedmolecular structure with the experimental structure (Figure 3d)shows excellent agreement, with RMSD = 0.079 ? (excludingH＊s).",surface area

"←RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSynthesis and Characterization of the Cage Com-pounds. Purely organic trigonal-prismatic cages are relativelyuncommon, although they are one of the simplest possiblearchitectures known to date. The shape-persistent prismaticCC1rwas easily obtained ( ‵80% yield) via the reaction of atriphenyl amine-based trialdehyde Cwith a chiral diamine D[(S,S)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine]. The aldehyde building block Cwas synthesized by palladium-catalyzed Suzuki ?Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of tris(4-bromophenyl)amine ( A) and 3-formylphenylboronic acid ( B)(Scheme 1 ). The imine-basedcage compound CC1 was isolated as a pale yellow solid bytreating Cwith Din a 2:3 stoichiometric ratio in chloroformunder re ?ux for 48 h. The dynamic nature of imine bonds ensuresthe formation of the thermodynamically most stable product inequilibrium, which herein involves condensation between 3equiv of diamine and 2 equiv of trialdehyde. Among all thepossible architectures, the molecular prism is enthalpicallyfavored owing to its having the least angle strain, as well asentropically favored as it comprises a minimum number ofbuilding blocks.",comprehensive synthesis

"Since the first descriptions of porous organic cages by Cooper et al. and Atwood et al. in 2009,1,2 the field has rapidly developed.3, 4 Meanwhile, systems have been realized with specific Brunauer -Emmett -Teller (BET) surface areas > 2000 m2/g,5 with mesopores ,6, 7 or highly selective  sorption of gases such CO 2,8, 9 SF6,10 or various noble gases.11 In cont rast to three -dimensional porous network systems, the organic cages are usually solub le and can therefore be processed into thin -films used for sensoring12, 13  or embedded  into membranes14, 15  for enhancing the selective separation of gases. What distinguishes por ous organic cages from insoluble networks  most  is the recently reported possibility to use organic cages to realize even porous liquids.16 With a few exceptions ,17 most shape -persistent organic cages are meanwhile synthesized by applying dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC), such as by the formation of imines through  the condensation of amines and aldehydes or the formation of boronic esters by the condensation of boronic acids and diols.18 Because the reactions are reversible, the most thermodynamically st able compound s are  usually formed from rather simple building blocks  in excellent yields because the system s can self -correct.  The obvious synthetic advantage of the reversibility is accompanied with a drawback  from a materials perspective, because the final product usually lacks chemi cal stability. In this respect , boronic ester cages are much more  labile than imine cages . Indeed, if acid an d nucleophiles (such as water) are absent in combination, imine cages have been shown to be some what  stable.19 In the presence of acid and nucleophile the imine bonds are usually cleaved very  fast leading to a decomposition of the molecular cage into smaller units, at the same time losing  porosity . One exception  are pyrogallol -based cages , where the formed imine bond is tautomerizing to a more stable enamine bond.  These cages have been reported to be stable in acidic solution up to pH 1 and basic solution up to pH 14.20 The stability after chemical treatment has been investigated by IR and PXRD only and PXRD data after acid or base -treatment show ed besides the original peaks a number of additional peaks.  However, although the cages are solu ble in common organic solvents the post -treatment compounds have not further been analysed by NMR spectroscopy.",surface area
"The reversibility of imine bond formation can be st opped by simple reduction to the corresponding amine function  with complex hydrides . Unfortunately, the reduction leads to a more flexible cage and finally the loss of shape -persistency is responsible for the loss of porosity.21-23 There have been  a very few approaches to post -functionalize organic cages.23-26 However, to  the best of our knowledge, the only  example for a post -functionalized chemical stabilization of porous organic imine cages has been described by. Cooper et al. :23 A small [4+6] imine cage was reduced to the corresponding amine cage and the internal ortho diamine functions were subsequently ＆tied＊ as aminals  with either one molecule of acetone or four molecules of formaldehyde .23 Whereas the acetone derived cage is decomposing already in solution, which was monitored by NMR, the formaldehyde derived a minal cage crystals were stable at room temperature in solutions with pH between 1.7 and 12.3  for at least 12 days . Whereas the aminal  cage tied with only one acetone was still too flexible to be shape -persistent, the one tied with four formaldehydes retained shape -persistency. This was reflected by apparent BET surface areas of 67 m2/g and 377 m2/g, respectively.",surface area
"The isotherm can best be described as a mixture of a type I and a type IV isotherm.30 The calculated specific surface area of cage 3 is with 105  m2/g (BET  model) substantially lower than for [2+3] -imine cage 1 (744 m2/g), but it is much larger than for the more flexible corresponding amine cage 2 (12 m2/g), which is in accordance to reported data of other, flexible amine cages.21-23 Figure 2 .

"A second sample was prepared by dissolving the carbamate cage 3 in hot DMSO  and dripping this solution into cold water to crush out the compound.  The precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with water and immersed first in acetone (7x) and finally in n -pentane (7x) before activating at 200 oC in vacuum (16 h). The nitrogen sorption isotherm was very similar to the first sample (BET SA = 113 m2/g), suggesting that the sample is rather a mixture of both polymorphs with a substantially higher content of the nonporous polymorph 汕.",surface area
"This sample was treated with acid (10 M HCl, 16 h at rt) and investigated again by gas sorption and SEM. The crystallite morphology did not change  after treatment with acid (nor by base, s ee Figure S38). The apparent BET SA measu red by N 2 at 77 K was  194 m2/g and a comparable amount of CO 2 (11.2 wt% at 1 bar and 273 K) was adsorbed;  once more showing that the treatment is not affecting the materials properties.",surface area

According to the  TGA the compound was activated thermally (200 oC, 3 h), before measuring gas sorption. At 77 K the compound adsorbs 148 cm3/g nitrogen.",topology
"However, despite the apparently small  specific surface area of cage 3 measured by N 2 adsorption  at 77 K , the compound adsorbed relatively large amounts of CO 2 at 273 K and 1 bar (58 cm3/g; 11.5 wt%),  suggesting that the diffusion of gas molecules is kinetically hindered at 77 K, because of the win ded pore -system, some narrow ed sites and the found dead -ends. Another possibility that needs to be taken into account is a substantial transformation of polymorph 汐 to polymorph 汕 by the activation process, which need to be investigated in more detail. It is worth mentioning that for a flexible [2+3] imine cage, which we published before,27 a very similar behavi our was found. The amount of adsorbed CO 2 is comparable to other porous materials derived from cages of similar size s and much higher than e.g. for flexible amine cages  (see Table 1);21 but lower than e.g. for a cubic imine cage (18.2wt%).8 Furthermore , c) d)dead -enda) b)Page 3 of 4 ChemCommChemComm Accepted Manuscript Published on 07 July 2017.

"To summarize, we introduced a chemical post -stabilization of prior lab ile [2+3] imine cage 1 in a two -step approach by first reduction of the imine bonds to amine bonds, followed by a reaction with N,N＊ -carbonyldiimidazole to give the carbamate cage 3. The cage is stable in 1 M hydrochloric acid (pH = 0) , even when heated at 100 oC and also in concentrated hydrochloric acid (pH = -1) at room temperature , at least for 16 hours. The carbamate cage is also stable in 1 M aqueou s NaOH -solution (pH = 14). C age 3 is permanent porous and took up significant amoun ts of CO 2 (11.5 wt%) at 273 K and 1 bar. To the best of our knowledge, this is in respect to the broad pH range the most stable porous organic cage compound described  to date . The carbamate formation is not restricted to the here described [2+3] imine cage  1 or amine cage 2 and can be applied to all cages, derived from salicylaldehyde s and aromatic amine precursors.5, 8, 13, 33 -40  We would like to thank the DFG for financial support (project MA4061 -4/2 and SFB 1249), the China Scholarship  Coun cil (CSC) for a scholarship for X. -Y.

General remarks  All reagents and solvents were used without further purification unless otherwise noted.  2,7,14 -triaminotriptycene  2 was synthesized according to  a procedure reported in literature. [S1] For thin layer chromatography silica gel 60 F254 plates from Merck were used and examined under UV-light irradiation (254 nm and 365 nm). Flash column chromatography was done  using Silica gel 60 (40 每 63 米m / 230 每 400 mesh ASTM) purchased from Macherey -Nagel  using dichloromethane  and methanol.  Recycling gel permeation chromatography was performed with a Shimadzu DGU -20A3R degassing unit, LC -20AD pump unit, CTO -20AC column oven, CBM -20A communication bus module, SPD -M20A diode array detector, FRC10A fraction collector, FCV -20AH2 valve unit, a PSS SDV (20 x 50 mm) precolumn and three SDV 100 ? (20 x 300 mm) columns connected in series . Melting  points (not corrected) were measured with a B邦chi Melting Point B -540. IR-Spectra were recorded on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer on a ZnSe ATR crystal. NMR spectra were taken on a Bruker Avance III 500 (500 MHz) and Bruker Avance III 600 (600 MHz) spectrometer. Chemical shifts ( 汛) are reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to traces of the nondeuterated solvent in the corresponding deuterated solvent. MALDI -TOF MS experiments were carried out on a Bruker Daltonik Reflex III, on a Bruker ApexQe  or on a Bruker AutoFlex Speed TOF with DCTB (trans -2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl) -2-methyl -2-propenylidene]malononitrile)  and dithranol ( 1,8-Dihydroxy -9(10H) -anthracenone ) as matrix . Electron micrographs were acquired using a Crossbeam 540 field emission scann ing electron microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Germany). Imaging was performed with a working distance of 3.0 mm and a landing energy between 1.0 keV and 3.0 keV. The secondary electron images were recorded by an Inlens -detector and the backscattered electron images recorded by an EsB -detector. The powder sample was suspended in isopropanol, treated with ultrasound and drop -casted onto a silicon wafer substrate pre -cleaned in air -plasma.

THF (14 mL) under argon atmosphere and stirred for seven days at RT. The reaction mixture was sonicated every day to remove the solids stuck on the sides of the flask. The orange precipitate was filtered over a glass frit (pore 4), washed with Et 3N/THF abs. solution (40 米L Et 3N in 4 mL THF abs), dried under high vacuum (10-2 bar) to afford 154 mg (0.07 mmol, 83 %) of cage compound 1 as a yellow solid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 2,7,14-triaminotriptycene (2)       | Synthesized according to a procedure reported in literature.

"Reaction of a spiropyran-functionalized dialdehyde 4with a?exible triamine tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (tren) easily yieldeddiscrete organic cage PC2 in 62% yield. The aldehyde buildingblock 4was synthesized by palladium-catalyzed Suzuki ?Miyaura cross-coupling reaction between bromo-spiropyran 3and diformylphenylboronic ester 2(Scheme 1 ). The imine-based cage compound PC1 was isolated as a yellow solid bytreating compound 4with the triamine ※tren §in 3:2stoichiometric ratio in chloroform at room temperature for48 h. The cage PC1 was converted into more stable amine cagePC2 by sodium borohydride reduction of the dynamic iminebonds. The as-synthesized PC2 was characterized by multi-nuclear NMR (1H,13C),1H?1H COSY, FT-IR, and ESI-MSanalyses.

"Department of Inorganic and Physical Chemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560012, India*SSupporting InformationABSTRACT: A discrete nanoscopic organic cage ( OC1R) hasbeen synthesized from a phenothiazine based trialdehydetreating with chiral 1,2-cyclohexanediamine building block viadynamic imine bond formation followed by reductiveamination. The cage compound has been characterized byseveral spectroscopic methods, which advocate that OC1Rhastrigonal prismatic shape formed via [2 + 3] self-assembledimine condensation followed by imine reduction. This newlydesigned cage has aromatic walls and porous interiordecorated with two cyclic thioether and three vicinal diaminemoieties suitable for binding gold ions to engineer thecontrolled nucleation and stabilization of ultra ?ne goldnanoparticles (AuNPs). The functionalized con ?ned pocketof the cage has been used for the controlled synthesis ofAuNPs with narrow size distribution via encapsulation of Au(III) ions. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometric (ICP-MS) analysis revealed that the composite Au@OC1Rhas very high ( ‵68 wt %) gold loading. In distinction, reduction of goldsalts in absence of the cage yielded structureless agglomerates. The ?ne-dispersed cage anchored AuNPs ( Au@OC1R) havebeen ?nally used as potential heterogeneous photocatalyst for very facile and selective conversion of nitroarenes to respectiveazo compounds at ambient temperature in just 2 h reaction time. Exceptional chemical stability and reusability without anyagglomeration of AuNPs even after several cycles of use are the potential features of this material. The composite Au@OC1Rrepresents the ?rst example of organic cage supported gold nanoparticles as photocatalyst.",affiliation

And,the following opposite rotational directions, two distinct chiral enan-tiomers, the racemic 2 P-CHO-TMC and 2 M-CHO-TMC are formed,exhibiting mirror-symmetric structures (Fig. 2). By computationalanalysis, the racemic 2 P-CHO-TMC and 2 M-CHO-TMCshowed the sametotal energy of ?4395.2800 Ha (Supplementary Fig. 36). In theassembly of the crystal lattice, these enantiomers coexist in equalproportions, resulting in an intertwined network structure (Supple-mentary Fig. 31). It is essential to highlight that separating theseenantiomers proves impractical, primarily due to the partial freedomof rotation and vibration exhibited by the phenyl rings within themolecular cage in solution. This ?exibility facilitates their inter-conversion, a process that lacks any discernible signals in circulardichroism (CD) spectra. (Supplementary Fig. 40). As demonstrated byZheng ＊sg r o u p55who successfully achieved the separation of enantio-mers with differing rotational directions of the phenyl rings byimplementing strategies that rest rict and impede the rotation of thephenyl rings. From a structural perspective, the O-bridged [2 + 3]molecular cage TMC (3D) and its scaffold TPB (2D) indeed share asimilar tri-bladed propeller-shaped helical structure in differentdimensions. Therefore, by incorporating 4-hydroxybenzene into themolecular cage CHO-TMC by the same C 每O每C bonds (SupplementaryFig. 32), it becomes possible to utilize this modi ?ed cage as a buildingblock for constructing higher-level [2[2 + 3] + 3] molecular cagesthrough a cage-to-cage strategy, where two instances of the modi ?edcage are assembled together to form a larger and more complexmolecular cage. The resulting structure would exhibit self-similarity,meaning that it retains the same overall pattern or structure at dif-ferent scales or levels of magni ?cation.",topology
"Synthesis of higher-level molecular cage 4 P-HTMC and 4 M-HTMC and their structure characterizationsFor the synthesis of [2[2 + 3] + 3] higher-level molecular cage, thebuilding block racemic CHO-TMC was reacted respectively with ( R,R)-or (S,S)-diaminocyclohexane (CHDA) in dichloromethane with cata-lysis amount of tri ?uoroacetic acid (TFA) at room temperaturethrough DCC (Fig. 1and Supplementary Figs. 2, 3, and 6 每9). Atten-tionally, regardless of the duration of the reaction or the temperatureat which it is conducted, the reaction of molecular cage CHO-TMCremains incomplete until an excess amount of CHDA is added. Afterthe CHO-TMC was consumed by the excess CHDA, the enantiopurehigher-level molecular cages 4 P-HTMC and 4 M-HTMC were obtainedwith yields of 94% and 91% by participating with MeOH. The obtainedcages 4 P-HTMC and 4 M-HTMC were characterized unambiguously byMALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, NMR, and SC-XRD. The results ofMALDI-TOF mass spectrometry showed that the 4 P-HTMC and 4 M-HTMC calcd for C174H120N24O18[M + H]+: 2835.96, found: 2835.93(Supplementary Fig. 28 and 29). Compared with the building blocksCHO-TMC, the increased steric hindrance in cages 4 P-HTMC and 4 M-HTMC promotes stronger 羽-羽stacking between the aromatic rings,resulting in a higher electron density in the stacked system. As a con-sequence, the proton signals experience an up-shift in their chemicalshifts. Additionally, the proton signals ( d, e, f ) of TPB units in buildingblock CHO-TMC are split into two sets of proton signals ( d, e, f andd＊,e＊,f＊)i nc a g e s4 P-HTMC and 4 M-HTMC.

The TPB units located on the inner side exhibit astrong shielding effect and, therefore, lead to a further up-shift of 0.38ppm (Fig. 3a). To con ?rm the fascinating phenomenon of intramole-cular self-shielding effect29, the 2D NMR spectra, such as1H,1H-COSY,1H,1H-NOESY,1H,13C-HSQC and1H,13C-HMBC NMR (SupplementaryFigs. 14 每21), can provide valuable information about the connectivityand spatial relationships within the molecules, which can help verifythe presence of the shielding effect and provide further evidencesupporting the observed up-shift and splitting of the proton signals.",topology
"In summary, a pair of enantiopure higher-level molecular cages4P-HTMC and 4 M-HTMC were synthesized by utilizing the racemicTPB-based [2 + 3] O-bridged oxacalixarene molecular cage (TMC) as3D tri-bladed propeller shaped building blocks through DCC. TheX-ray single crystal analysis showed that they exhibit elegant 3D tri-bladed propeller-shaped self-similar superstructures that resem-bled building blocks CHO-TMC and TPBs across the double andtriple-scaled expansion, respectively. The intrinsic cavity (3.9 ?) ofbuilding blocks was well preserved, and the new cavity (9.8 ?) wasintroduced as the cage-based OMCs 4 P-HTMC and 4 M-HTMCformed. The unique structural transformation leads to the creationof hetero-pores within a single molecular cage and intramolecularself-shielding effect, a feat that is challenging to achieve in currentOMCs. It is indeed intriguing that the assembly of 4 P-HTMC and 4 M-HTMC demonstrates exclusive narcissistic self-sorting and chiralinter-transformation, a phenomenon driven by steric hindrance andintricate chiral induction and ?xation.

"Synthesis of  CC3:  CC3-R was prepared as previously reported in its homochiral form.[1] Dichloromethane (100 ml) was layered slowly onto solid triformylbenzene (TFB, 5 g, 30.86 mmol) without stirring at room temperature. Trifluoroacetic acid (1 mL) was adde d directly to this solution as a catalyst for the imine bond formation. Finally, a solution of ( R,R)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane (5 g, 44.64 mmol) in dichloromethane (100 mL) was added to this, again without mixing. The reaction was covered and left to stand. Over 5 days, al l of the SUPPORTING INFORMATION           2  solid triformylbenzene was used up and octahedral crystals of CC3 grew on the sides o f the glass reaction vessel. The crystalline product was removed by filtration and washed with 95 % ethanol / 5 % dichloromethane.",comprehensive synthesis
"A large -scale synthesis of CC3 has also been recently developed, a typical procedure is described as follows.  A batch reacto r was charged with 4,000 mL of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and pre -heated to 50 ∼C. 1,3,5 -Triformylbenzene (400g, 2.46 mol) and solid ( R,R)-1,2-Diaminocyclohexane (431g, 3.77 mol) were added to the pre -heated solvent under continuous stirring. After stirring f or five minutes, trifluoroacetic acid (8 mL, 0.047 mol) was added to the reaction mixture. Once the addition of the acid was complete the reaction is slowly ramped up to 78  ∼C and held for 17 hours with continuous stirring. After 17 hours the reactor is co oled to room temperature and the resulting off -white suspension is collected by vacuum filtration. This solid is then washed with further IPA and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 ∼C overnight to yield CC3 as a fine white powder.  Yield 623 g, 94.7%.",comprehensive synthesis
"Synthesis of RCC3 : RCC3 was prepared and purified as previously reported .[2] The imine cage CC3 -R (926 mg, 0.83 mmol) was dissolved in a CHCl 3 / methanol mixture (1:1 v/v, 50 mL) by stirring. When this solution became clear, sodium borohydride (1.00 g, 26.5 mol) was added and the reaction was stirred for a further 12 hours at room temperature. Water ( 2 mL) was then added, and the reaction stirred for a further 12 hours. The solvent was then removed under vacuum. The resulting white solid was extracted with chlor oform (2 ℅ 50 mL) and then the combined organic phase was washed by water (2 ℅ 100 mL). The CHCl 3 phase was dried using anhydrous MgSO 4 before being removed under vacuum. RCC3 (crude yield = 900 mg, 95.1 %) was obtained as a white solid. RCC3 was purified by using the reversible reaction with acetone. In a 250 mL flask, 1000 mg crude RCC3 was dis solved in acetone (100 mL). The solution was covered and left to stand. Crystals started appearing on the wall of the flask after 30 mins. The crystals (AT -RCC3) were collected after one day by filtration and were then dissolved in a CHCl 3 /CH 3OH mixture ( 1:1 v/v) by stirring. Several drops of distilled water were added to the solution and the mixture was stirred for another 12 h.

"Thehighest SO2capture wasachieved with 6FT-RCC3,reaching amaximum uptake of13.68 mmol g/C01(Figure 2),thisuptake isonly behind thereported benchmark MOFs such asMOF-177,[36a]MIL-101(Cr) 4F(1 %),[21]orMFM-170[43c](25.7,18.4 and17.5mmol g/C01,respectively). Itisworth noting thattheBET surface area ofabovementioned three MOFs allexceeds 2000 m2g/C01,while for6FT-RCC3 is396m2g/C01.Acomparison ofSO2uptakes andtheBET surface area ofsomerepresentative MOF materials isprovided inFigure S3whichhighlights thehighly competitive SO2capture performance of6FT-RCC3 cage,considering itsmodest surface area. Inter -estingly ,6FT-RCC3 shows asignificant SO2capacity atlowSO2pressures :at0.1bar6FT-RCC3 captures 8.67mmol g/C01ofSO2.Thisuptake isslightly ,higher than the value of8.28mmol g/C01at1barand 298Kobserved forMFM-300-(In),[20b]aM OF material with asuperior surface area(approximately 1100 m2g/C01).When comparing theSO2up-take by6FT-RCC3 atlowpartial pressures (e.g.,0.01bar,0.15barand 0.5bar) theSO2capacities were 3.57molg/C01;9.48mmol g/C01and11.94 mmol g/C01which outperforms severalMOF materials such as:MFM-170 (/C256.5mmol g/C01at0.1bar),[43]SIFSIX-3-Ni (2.43 mmol g/C01at0.01bar),[44a]MOF-177 (0.3mmol g/C01at0.01bar,1.0mmol g/C01at0.1bar),[36a]MIL-125(T i)-NH2(3.0mmol g/C01at0.01bar,7.9mmol g/C01at0.1bar);[36a]aswell asvarious polymers/COF materials ,suchasCTF-CSU41 (6.7mmol g/C01at0.15bar)andCTF-CSU38 (4.4mmol g/C01ofat0.15bar);[45]ionic micro-porous polymer P(Ph-4MVIm-Br) (2.43 mmol g/C01at0.01barand4.14mmol g/C01at0.1bar);[44b]anditiscomparable toMOFSIFSIX-1-Cu (3.43 SO2mmol g/C01at0.01bar) (see Fig-ureS4).[44a]Thisremarkable uptake atlow SO2partialpressures indicates thepossibility ofusing solid 6FT-RCC3fortrace SO2capture .",surface area
"Additional  experiments  In order to evaluate the stability of 6FT -RCC3 cage in the presence of SO 2 and humidity, we carried out a qualitative experiment with a homemade syst em previously reported (see Fig. S 16).[6], [7] The system contains two principal parts: SO 2 gas generator (A) dropping funnel with H 2O. [1] connected to a Schlenk flask with Na 2SO 3(s) under stirring [2]; and the saturation chamber (B), constructed from a round flask with distilled water [3], connected to a sintered glass filter adapter (without  humidity trap) [4] and to a vacuum line [5]. The activated cage sample is placed on the glass filter adapter and exposed for 3 days to SO 2 and H 2O vapor.  After, N 2 adsorption was evaluated (see Fig. S 15). In comparison to the reported for 6F -RCC3 cage,[2] the BET surface area decreased from 396 to 375 m2 g-1 after the exposure to SO 2 and H2O. No apparent changes were observed in porous organic cage after exposure to SO 2 and water stays  intact as confirmed by 1H NMR  (Fig. S13).",surface area

General Remarks  All reagents and solvents were obtained from Fisher Scientific, Alfa Aesar, Sigma -Aldrich or VWR and were used without further purification unless otherwise noted. For thin layer chromatography silica gel 60 F 254 plates from Merck were used and examined under UV -light irradiation (254  nm and 365  nm). Flash column chromatography was performed on silica gel from Sigma -Aldrich (particle size: 0.04 -0.063  mm) using petroleum ether, ethyl acetate and dichloromethane . Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) was performed on BioBeads S -X1 from Bio -Rad Laboratories, Inc. using dichloromethane as solvent. Melting points (not corrected) were measured with a B邦chi Melting Point B -540. IR-Spectra were recorded on a Ge ATR crysta l with a Bruker Lumos spectrometer or on a Jasco FT/IR -4100 spectrometer.  NMR spectra were taken on Bruker Avance III 600 (1H NMR: 600  MHz; 13C NMR: 151  MHz), Avance III 500 (1H NMR: 500  MHz; 13C NMR: 125 MHz), Avance III 400 (1H NMR: 400 MHz; 13C NMR: 100  MHz), Avance DRX 300 and Avance III 300 (1H NMR: 300 MHz, 13C NMR: 75 MHz) spectrometer at 298 K, unless otherwise mentioned.

One-pot reactionofappropriate di-/tri-acyl chloride with adiamine generallyresults polymers oroligomers instead ofdiscrete architec-tures. Toovercome this limitation, astrategy isreported hereusing dynamic imine chemistry for facile construction ofimine-based macrocycle and cage upon treatment ofadiamine with di-and tri-aldehydes respectively, followed bypost-synthesis one-step conversion ofimine bonds toamidestoform the desired robust macrocycle and cage containingmultiple amide bonds. While the macrocycle was found toform aggregates inDMSO, the cage was intact without anyaggregation. Sixamide groups inthe confined pocket ofthecage made itan ideal receptor for selective binding offluoride with very high selectivity (~3?103fold) over chloride,and itwas silent towards other halides, phosphate, and otheroxyanions.",this paper's author

The Schi ?base condensation has beenwidely used for the construction of MIMs due to its reversiblebond formation and self-healing behavior.28In this work, the[2 + 3] Schi ?base condensation is supposed to lead to theformation of a cage structure. To our surprise, the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of- ?ight mass spec-trometry (MALDI-TOF MS) revealed that the molecularweight of the obtained compound ( Cage-1 ) was 2596, which istwice the molecular weight of a monomeric molecular cage(1298). This observation suggested the formation of dualinterlocked cages. Subsequently, two control experiments weredone ( Figure 1 ).
